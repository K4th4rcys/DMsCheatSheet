<p>See <a href=\"http://class.com/Barbarian\">Barbarian</a>&nbsp;for the main class description.</p>
<p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end, that&nbsp;end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path&nbsp;of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter&nbsp;the berserker&rsquo;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle,&nbsp;heedless of your own health or well-being.</p>
<p><em><strong>Frenzy</strong></em><br />Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you&nbsp;can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for&nbsp;the duration of your rage you can make a single melee&nbsp;weapon attack as a bonus action on each o f your turns&nbsp;after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level&nbsp;of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).</p>
<p><em><strong>Mindless Rage</strong></em><br />Beginning at 6th level, you can&rsquo;t be charmed or&nbsp;frightened while raging. If you are charmed or&nbsp;frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is&nbsp;suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Intimidating Presence</strong></em><br />Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to&nbsp;frighten someone with your menacing presence.&nbsp;When you do so, choose one creature that you can see&nbsp;within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear&nbsp;you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened o f you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. <br />If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>
<p><em><strong>Retaliation</strong></em><br />Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from&nbsp;a creature that is within 5 feet o f you. you can use&nbsp;your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against&nbsp;that creature.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Barbarian\">Barbarian</a>&nbsp;for the main class description.</p>
<p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as&nbsp;the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,&nbsp;and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you&nbsp;with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your&nbsp;barbarian rage.<br />Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be&nbsp;kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for&nbsp;an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,&nbsp;though exceptions exist.</p>
<p><br /><em><strong>Spirit Seeker</strong></em><br />Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural&nbsp;world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when&nbsp;you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast&nbsp;sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,&nbsp;as described in chapter 10.</p>
<p><em><strong>Totem Spriti</strong></em><br />At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a&nbsp;totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or&nbsp;acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar&nbsp;adornment, that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,&nbsp;teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you&nbsp;also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent&nbsp;of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear&nbsp;totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thickskinned,&nbsp;or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn&nbsp;bright yellow.&nbsp;Your totem animal might be an animal related to those&nbsp;listed here but more appropriate to your homeland.<br />For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in&nbsp;place of an eagle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bear.</strong> While raging, you have resistance to all damage&nbsp;except psychic damage. The spirit o f the bear makes you&nbsp;tough enough to stand up to any punishment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eagle.</strong> While you're raging and aren&rsquo;t wearing&nbsp;heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on&nbsp;opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the&nbsp;Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit&nbsp;of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave&nbsp;through the fray with ease.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf</strong>, While you're raging, your friends have&nbsp;advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature&nbsp;within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of&nbsp;the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Aspect of the Beast</strong><br />At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the&nbsp;totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same&nbsp;animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bear.</strong> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying&nbsp;capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift)&nbsp;is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks&nbsp;made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.<br /><br /><strong>Eagle</strong>. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can&nbsp;see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern&nbsp;even fine details as though looking at something no&nbsp;more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim&nbsp;light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom&nbsp;(Perception) checks.<br /><br /><strong>Wolf</strong>, You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You&nbsp;can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace,&nbsp;and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal&nbsp;pace.<br /><br /><em><strong>Spirit Walker</strong></em><br />At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature&nbsp;spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual&nbsp;version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit&nbsp;or Aspect o f the Beast appears to you to convey the&nbsp;information you seek.</p>
<p><br /><em><strong>Totemic Attunement</strong></em><br />At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a&nbsp;totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same&nbsp;animal you selected previously or a different one.<br /><br /><strong>Bear</strong>, While you&rsquo;re raging, any creature within 5 feet&nbsp;of you that&rsquo;s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack&nbsp;rolls against targets other than you or another character&nbsp;with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it&nbsp;can&rsquo;t see or hear you or if it can&rsquo;t be frightened.<br /><br /><strong>Eagle</strong>. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to&nbsp;your current walking speed. This benefit works only in&nbsp;short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and&nbsp;nothing else is holding you aloft.<br /><br /><strong>Wolf</strong>. While you&rsquo;re raging, you can use a bonus action&nbsp;on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone&nbsp;when you hit it with melee w eapon attack.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Bard\">Bard</a>&nbsp;for the main class description.<br /><br />Bards of the College o f Lore know something about&nbsp;most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources&nbsp;as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales.&nbsp;Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate&nbsp;compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts&nbsp;to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies&nbsp;down, the audience members might find themselves&nbsp;questioning everything they held to be true, from their&nbsp;faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their&nbsp;loyalty to the king.<br />The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty&nbsp;and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the&nbsp;tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a&nbsp;herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be&nbsp;honest than politic.<br />The college&rsquo;s members gather in libraries and&nbsp;sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms&nbsp;and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.&nbsp;They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they&nbsp;can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant&nbsp;figures of authority.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bonus Proficiencies</strong></em><br />When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain&nbsp;proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cutting Words</strong></em><br />Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to&nbsp;distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and&nbsp;competence of others. When a creature that you can&nbsp;see within 60 feet o f you makes an attack roll, an ability&nbsp;check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to&nbsp;expend one of your uses o f Bardic Inspiration, rolling&nbsp;a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number&nbsp;rolled from the creature&rsquo;s roll. You can choose to use&nbsp;this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before&nbsp;the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability&nbsp;check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its&nbsp;damage. The creature is immune if it can&rsquo;t hear you or if&nbsp;it&rsquo;s immune to being charmed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Additional Magical Secrets</strong></em><br />At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any&nbsp;class. A spell you choose must be o f a level you can cast,&nbsp;as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen&nbsp;spells count as bard spells for you but don&rsquo;t count&nbsp;against the number o f bard spells you know.</p>
<p><em><strong>Peerless Skill</strong></em><br />Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check,&nbsp;you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a&nbsp;Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to&nbsp;your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil&nbsp;the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you&nbsp;whether you succeed or fail.</p>",

<p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn&rsquo;t pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bonus Proficiencies<br /></strong></em>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</p>
<p><em><strong>Combat Inpsiration<br /></strong></em>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p>
<p><em><strong>Extra Attack<br /></strong></em>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<p><em><strong>Battle Magic<br /></strong></em>At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>",

<p>Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and the fuel both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.<br />The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as leanering and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand.</p>

<h3><strong>Channel Divinity:</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Arcane Abjuration.</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures.<br />As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.<br />A turned creature must spend its turn trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&rsquo;t willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br />After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the&nbsp;<em>banishment</em>&nbsp;spell; no concentration required) if it isn&rsquo;t on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table.</p>

<h3><strong>Spell Breaker.</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.</p>
<h3><strong>Potent Spellcasting</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modigier to the damage you deal with an cleric cantrip.</p>

<p><strong>Channel Divinity:</strong><br /><strong>Touch of Death</strong></p>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature&rsquo;s life force by touch.<br />When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target.

<p><strong>Channel Divinity:</strong><br /><strong>Knowledge of the Ages</strong></p>
<p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature&rsquo;s thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature&rsquo;s mind to command it.<br />As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60ft of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.<br />If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about.) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.<br />During that time that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature without expending a spell slot.

<p><strong>visions of the Past</strong></p>

You can meditate in this way for a&nbsp;number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and&nbsp;must maintain concentration during that time, as if you&nbsp;were casting a spell.<br />Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until&nbsp;you finish a short or long rest.<br /><em><strong><br />Object Reading.</strong></em>&nbsp;Holding an object as you meditate,&nbsp;you can see visions of the object&rsquo;s previous owner.&nbsp;After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner&nbsp;acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent&nbsp;significant event involving the object and that owner.&nbsp;If the object was owned by another creature in the&nbsp;recent past (within a number of days equal to your&nbsp;Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute&nbsp;for each owner to learn the same information about&nbsp;that creature.<br /><br /><em><strong>Area Reading.</strong></em>&nbsp;As you meditate, you see visions&nbsp;of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room,&nbsp;street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube),&nbsp;going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom&nbsp;score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about&nbsp;one significant event, beginning with the most recent.&nbsp;Significant events typically involve powerful emotions,&nbsp;such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders,&nbsp;births and funerals.

<p><strong>Supreme Healing.</strong></p>
<p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell. You instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</p>",

<p><strong>Improved Flare.</strong></p>

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Druid\">Druid</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages&nbsp;who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through&nbsp;a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred&nbsp;circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal&nbsp;secrets in Druidic. The circle&rsquo;s wisest members preside&nbsp;as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old&nbsp;Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.&nbsp;As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced&nbsp;by the land where you were initiated into the circle&rsquo;s&nbsp;mysterious rites.</p>
<h3><strong>Bonus Cantrip</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one&nbsp;additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Natural Recovery</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your&nbsp;magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing&nbsp;with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended&nbsp;spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a&nbsp;combined level that is equal to or less than half your&nbsp;druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be&nbsp;6th level or higher. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until&nbsp;you finish a long rest&nbsp;For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can&nbsp;recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can&nbsp;recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>
<h3><strong>Circle Spells</strong></h3>
<p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with&nbsp;the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and&nbsp;9th level you gain access to circle spells connected&nbsp;to the land where you became a druid. Choose that&nbsp;land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain,&nbsp;swamp, or Underdark&mdash;and consult the associated&nbsp;list of spells.</p>

<p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have&nbsp;it prepared, and it doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of&nbsp;spells you can prepare each day.

<h3><strong>Land&rsquo;s Stride</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical&nbsp;difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can&nbsp;also pass through nonmagical plants without being&nbsp;slowed by them and without taking damage from them if&nbsp;they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.&nbsp;In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against&nbsp;plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede&nbsp;movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>
<h3><strong>Nature&rsquo;s Ward</strong></h3>
<p>When you reach 10th level, you can&rsquo;t be charmed or&nbsp;frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to&nbsp;poison and disease.</p>
<h3><strong>Nature&rsquo;s Sanctuary</strong></h3>
<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural&nbsp;world sense your connection to nature and become&nbsp;hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature&nbsp;attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving&nbsp;throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save,&nbsp;the creature must choose a different target, or the attack&nbsp;automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature&nbsp;is immune to this effect for 24 hours.&nbsp;The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its&nbsp;attack against you.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Druid\">Druid</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians&nbsp;of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to&nbsp;share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest&nbsp;parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks&nbsp;on end before crossing paths with another humanoid&nbsp;creature, let alone another druid.<br />Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might&nbsp;prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops&nbsp;as an eagle the next day, and crash through the&nbsp;undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing&nbsp;monster. The wild is in the druid&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<h3><strong>Combat Wild Shape</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the&nbsp;ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action,&nbsp;rather than as an action.&nbsp;Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild&nbsp;Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one&nbsp;spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell&nbsp;slot expended.</p>
<h3><strong>Circle Forms</strong></h3>
<p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform&nbsp;into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd&nbsp;level, you can use your W ild Shape to transform into a&nbsp;beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore&nbsp;the Max.

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Fighter\">Fighter</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banneret are knights who hail from a mighty kingdom. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond their kingdom&rsquo;s borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgement, bravery, and fidelity to the code of chivalry to guide them in defeating evildoers.<br />A Banneret inspires greatness in other by committing brake deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A long knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.<br />A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight&rsquo;s actions can never suspected they had.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction: Knighthood</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Rallying Cry</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.<br />When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three target creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.</p>
<h3><strong>Royal Envoy</strong></h3>
<p>A Banneret knight serves as an envoy of the crown. Knights of high standing are expected to conduct themselves with grace.<br />At 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.<br />Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from this feature.</p>
<h3><strong>Inspiring Surge</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you.<br />Starting at 17th level, you can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one.</p>
<h3><strong>Bulwark</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to re-roll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren&rsquo;t incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can re-roll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Fighter\">Fighter</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons o f history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p>
<h3><strong>Combat Superiority</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.<br /><em><strong>Maneuvers.</strong></em>&nbsp;You learn three maneuvers o f your choice, which are detailed under &ldquo;Maneuvers&rdquo; below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.&nbsp;<br />You learn two additional maneuvers o f your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.<br /><em><strong>Superiority Dice.</strong></em>&nbsp;You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all o f your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.&nbsp;<br />You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.<br /><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em>&nbsp;Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><em><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong></em>&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>
<h3><strong>Student of War</strong></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan&rsquo;s tools o f your choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Know Your Enemy</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:<br />&bull; Strength score<br />&bull; Dexterity score<br />&bull; Constitution score<br />&bull; Armor Class<br />&bull; Current hit points<br />&bull; Total class levels (if any)<br />&bull; Fighter class levels (if any)</p>
<h3><strong>Improved Combat Superiority</strong></h3>
<p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.</p>
<h3><strong>Relentless</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.</p>
<h3><strong>Maneuvers</strong></h3>
<p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.<br /><em><strong>Commander&rsquo;s Strike.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.<br /><em><strong>Disarming Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it&rsquo;s holding. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.<br /><em><strong>Distracting Strike.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.<br /><em><strong>Evasive Footwork.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.<br /><em><strong>Feinting Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.<br /><em><strong>Goading Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.<br /><em><strong>Lunging Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.<br /><em><strong>Maneuvering Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one o f your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target o f your attack.<br /><em><strong>Menacing Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.<br /><em><strong>Parry.</strong></em>&nbsp;When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.<br /><em><strong>Precision Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.<br /><em><strong>Pushing Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.<br /><em><strong>Rally.</strong></em>&nbsp;On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve o f one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature w ho can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.<br /><em><strong>Riposte.</strong></em>&nbsp;When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.<br /><em><strong>Sweeping Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.<br /><em><strong>Trip Attack.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>",

"full_text": "<h1>Eldritch Knight</h1>
<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Fighter\">Fighter</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter&rsquo;s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p>
<h3><strong>Spellcasting</strong></h3>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial&nbsp;prowess with the ability to cast spells.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em>&nbsp;<br />You learn two cantrips of your choice from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Wizard Spell List. You learn an additional wizard&nbsp;cantrip of your choice at 10th level.<br /><br /><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em>&nbsp;<br />The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table&nbsp;shows how many spell slots you have to cast your&nbsp;spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these&nbsp;spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or&nbsp;higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you<br />finish a long rest.&nbsp;For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and&nbsp;have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you&nbsp;can cast shield using either slot.<br /><br /><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong></em>&nbsp;<br />You know&nbsp;three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which&nbsp;you must choose from the abjuration and evocation<br />spells on the&nbsp;Wizard Spell List.&nbsp;The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight&nbsp;Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard&nbsp;spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be&nbsp;an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must&nbsp;be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance,&nbsp;when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one<br />new spell of 1st or 2nd level.&nbsp;The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can&nbsp;come from any school of magic.<br />Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can&nbsp;replace one of the wizard spells you know with another&nbsp;spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The&nbsp;new spell must be of a level for which you have spell&nbsp;slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell,&nbsp;unless you&rsquo;re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,&nbsp;or 20th level.<br /><br /><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em>&nbsp;<br />Intelligence is your spellcasting&nbsp;ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your&nbsp;spells through study and memorization. You use your&nbsp;Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting&nbsp;ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier<br />when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you&nbsp;cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

<h3><strong>Weapon Bond</strong></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical&nbsp;bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform&nbsp;the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done&nbsp;during a short rest. The w eapon must be within your&nbsp;reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which&nbsp;you touch the weapon and forge the bond.&nbsp;Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you&nbsp;can&rsquo;t be disarmed of that w eapon unless you are&nbsp;incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence,&nbsp;you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your&nbsp;turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.&nbsp;You can have up to two bonded w eapons, but can&nbsp;summon only one at a time with your bonus action.&nbsp;If you attempt to bond with a third w eapon, you must&nbsp;break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
<h3><strong>War Magic</strong></h3>

"full_text": "<h1 class=\"wiki-page-name title\">Way of the Four Elements</h1>
<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Monk\">Monk</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to&nbsp;harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can&nbsp;align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the&nbsp;four elements to your will, using them as an extension&nbsp;of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate&nbsp;themselves to a single element, but others weave the&nbsp;elements together.&nbsp;Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with&nbsp;representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined&nbsp;as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants,&nbsp;mountains, and cresting waves.</p>
<h3><strong>Disciple of the Elements</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn&nbsp;magical disciplines that harness the power of the four&nbsp;elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points&nbsp;each time you use it.&nbsp;You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and&nbsp;one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are&nbsp;detailed in the &ldquo;Elemental Disciplines&rdquo; section below.&nbsp;You learn one additional elemental discipline of your&nbsp;choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.&nbsp;Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline,&nbsp;you can also replace one elemental discipline that you&nbsp;already know with a different discipline.</p>
<p><em><strong>Casting Elemental Spells.</strong></em>&nbsp;<br />Some elemental&nbsp;disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for&nbsp;the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these<br />spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you&nbsp;don&rsquo;t need to provide material components for it.&nbsp;Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend&nbsp;additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental&nbsp;discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has&nbsp;an enhanced effect at a higher level, as&nbsp;<em>burning hands&nbsp;</em>does. The spell&rsquo;s level increases by 1 for each additional&nbsp;ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level&nbsp;monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast&nbsp;<em>burning&nbsp;hands</em>, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level&nbsp;spell (the discipline&rsquo;s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).&nbsp;The maximum number of ki points you can spend to&nbsp;cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost&nbsp;and any additional ki points you spend to increase its&nbsp;level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the&nbsp;Spells and Ki Points table.</p>
<h3><strong>Spells and Ki Points</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Monk Levels,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</strong></p>
<p>5th&mdash;8th &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3<br />9th&mdash;12th &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;4<br />13th&mdash;16th&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5<br />17th&mdash;20th &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;6</p>

You&nbsp;can change water to ice within the area and vice versa,&nbsp;and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you&nbsp;choose. You can raise or lower the ice&rsquo;s elevation, create&nbsp;or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar.&nbsp;The extent of any such changes can&rsquo;t exceed half the&nbsp;area&rsquo;s largest dimension. For example, if you affect a&nbsp;30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high,&nbsp;raise or lower the square&rsquo;s elevation by up to 15 feet, dig&nbsp;a trench up to 15 feet deep, and so on. You can&rsquo;t shape&nbsp;the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.</p>

<p>Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture creatures and prepare elaborate experiments to capture, record, and understand the moments of their demise. They then use this knowledge to guide their understanding of martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style.</p>
<h3><strong>Touch of Death</strong></h3>
<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your study of death allows you to extract vitality from another creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit points).</p>
<h3><strong>Hour of Reaping</strong></h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify those around you as an action, for your soul has been touched by the shadow of death. When you take this action, each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
<h3><strong>Mastery of Death</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 11th level, you use your familiarity with death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead.</p>
<h3><strong>Touch of the Long Death</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel the energy of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1 to 10 ki points.

<p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate&nbsp;masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or&nbsp;unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their&nbsp;opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their&nbsp;bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can&nbsp;protect them from harm.</p>
<h3><strong>Open Hand Technique</strong></h3>
<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level,&nbsp;you can manipulate your enemy&rsquo;s ki when you harness&nbsp;your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the&nbsp;attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose&nbsp;one of the following effects on that target:<br />&bull; It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be&nbsp;knocked prone.<br />&bull; It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you&nbsp;can push it up to 15 feet away from you.<br />&bull; It can&rsquo;t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>
<h3><strong>Wholeness of Body</strong></h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an&nbsp;action, you can regain hit points equal to three times<br />your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you&nbsp;can use this feature again.</p>
<h3><strong>Tranquility</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special&nbsp;meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At&nbsp;the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary&nbsp;spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the&nbsp;spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC&nbsp;for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your&nbsp;proficiency bonus.</p>
<h3><strong>Quivering Palm</strong></h3>
<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal&nbsp;vibrations in someone&rsquo;s body. When you hit a creature&nbsp;with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to&nbsp;start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a&nbsp;number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations&nbsp;are harmless unless you use your action to end them.&nbsp;To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane&nbsp;of existence. When you use this action, the creature&nbsp;must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is&nbsp;reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10&nbsp;necrotic damage.</p>
<p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this&nbsp;feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations&nbsp;harmlessly without using an action.</p>",

Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions.

<p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves&nbsp;and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called <em>fey knights</em>, <em>green knights</em>, or <em>horned knights</em>, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things&mdash;leaves, antlers, or flowers&mdash;to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Tenets of the Ancients</strong></h3>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple. <em><strong>Kindle the Light.</strong></em> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair. <em><strong>Shelter the Light.</strong></em> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the w ickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren. <em><strong>Preserve Your Own Light.</strong></em> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can&rsquo;t preserve it in the world. Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</p>
<h3><strong>Oath Spells</strong></h3>
<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>

<h3><strong>Channel Divinity</strong></h3>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. <br /><em><strong>Nature&rsquo;s Wrath.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish. <br /><em><strong>Turn the Faithless.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient w ords that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature&rsquo;s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>
<h3><strong>Aura of Warding</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
<h3><strong>Undying Sentinel</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can&rsquo;t be aged magically.</p>
<h3><strong>Elder Champion</strong></h3>
<p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or mosslike, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: <br />&bull; At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points. <br />&bull; Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead. <br />&bull; Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></div>",

<p>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign of service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threatened to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order&rsquo;s ranks.</p>
<h3><strong>Tenets of the Crown</strong></h3>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.<br /><strong>Law.</strong> The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.<br /><strong>Loyalty.</strong> Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.<br /><strong>Courage.</strong> You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don&rsquo;t act, then who will?<br /><strong>Responsibility.</strong> You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.</p>

<p>See <a href=\"http://class.com/Paladin\">Paladin </a>for the class description.</p>
<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called <em>cavaliers</em>, <em>white knights</em>, or <em>holy warriors</em>, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&rsquo; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels&mdash;the perfect servants of good&mdash;as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>
<h3><strong>Tenets of Devotion</strong></h3>
<p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. <br /><em><strong>Honesty</strong>.</em> Don&rsquo;t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. <br /><em><strong>Courage.</strong></em> Never fear to act, though caution is wise. <br /><em><strong>Compassion.</strong></em> Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. <br /><em><strong>Honor.</strong></em> Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. <br /><em><strong>Duty.</strong></em> Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</p>

<h3><strong>Channel Divinity</strong></h3>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. <br /><strong>Sacred Weapon.</strong> As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. <br /><strong>Turn the Unholy.</strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>

"full_text": "<h1>Oath of Vengeance</h1>
<p>See <a href=\"http://class.com/Paladin\">Paladin </a>for the class description.</p>
<p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the w ill of the gods, when a thieves&rsquo; guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside&mdash;at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins&mdash; sometimes called <em>avengers</em> or <em>dark knights</em> &mdash;their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</p>
<h3><strong>Tenets of Vengeance</strong></h3>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins w ho uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those w ho do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple. <br /><em><strong>Fight the Greater Evil.</strong></em> <br />Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil. <br /><em><strong>No Mercy for the Wicked.</strong></em> <br />Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not. <br /><em><strong>By Any Means Necessary.</strong></em> <br />My qualms can&rsquo;t get in the way of exterminating my foes. <br /><em><strong>Restitution.</strong></em> <br />If my foes w reak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</p>

<h3><strong>Channel Divinity</strong></h3>

Choose one creature within 60 feet o f you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature&rsquo;s speed is 0, and it can&rsquo;t benefit from any bonus to its speed. On a successful save, the creature&rsquo;s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage. <br /><br /><em><strong>Vow of Enmity.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can utter a vow o f enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet o f you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p>
<h3><strong>Relentless Avenger</strong></h3>
<p>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe&rsquo;s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
<h3><strong>Soul of Vengeance</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow o f Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p>
<h3><strong>Avenging Angel</strong></h3>
<p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits: <br />&bull; Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet. <br />&bull; You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

<h3><strong>Ranger&rsquo;s Companion</strong></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you.

<p>You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check. In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.</p>
<h3><strong>Magical Ambush</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.</p>
<h3><strong>Versatile Trickster</strong></h3>
<p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your <em>mage hand</em>. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.</p>
<h3><strong>Spell Thief</strong></h3>
<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.<br />Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell&rsquo;s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn&rsquo;t need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can&rsquo;t cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Rogue\">Rogue</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.</p>
<h3><strong>Bonus Proficiencies</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner&rsquo;s kit.</p>
<h3><strong>Assasinate</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn&rsquo;t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>
<h3><strong>Infiltration Expertise</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can&rsquo;t establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p>
<h3><strong>Imposter</strong></h3>
<p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person&rsquo;s speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person&rsquo;s behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</p>
<h3><strong>Death Strike</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p>",

<p>Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.</p>
<h3><strong>Master of Intrigue</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, allowing you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.</p>
<h3><strong>Master of Tactics</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.</p>
<h3><strong>Insightful Manipulator</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about it capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p><ul><li>Intelligence Score</li><li>Wisdom Score</li><li>Charisma Score</li><li>Class Levels (if any)</li></ul>
<h3><strong>Misdirection</strong></h3>
<p>At 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.</p>
<h3><strong>Soul of Deceit</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can&rsquo;t be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check.<br />Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful, if you so choose, and you can&rsquo;t be compelled to tell the truth by magic.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

<p>You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charisma in equal parts. While other warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks more like performance. Rakes, duelists, and pirates typically follow this archetype. <br />A swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Fancy Footwork</strong></p>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can&rsquo;t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Rakish Audacity</strong></p>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, your unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.<br />In addition, you don&rsquo;t need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</p>
<p><strong>Panache</strong></p>
<p>At 9th level, your charm becomes as sharp and dangerous as your blade. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language. <br />If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can&rsquo;t make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attack the target of affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.<br />If you succeed on the check and the creature is not hostile, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p>
<p><strong>Elegant Maneuver</strong></p>
<p>Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.</p>
<p><strong>Master Duelist</strong></p>
<p>At 17th level your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure to success in combat. If you miss with an attack, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn&rsquo;t employ.</p>
<h3><strong>Fast Hands</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves&rsquo; tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</p>
<h3><strong>Second-Story Work</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<h3><strong>Supreme Sneak</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Magic Device</strong></h3>
<p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>
<h3><strong>Thief&rsquo;s Reflexes</strong></h3>
<p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can&rsquo;t use this feature when you are surprised.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Sorcerer\">Sorcerer</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times w ho made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</p>
<h3><strong>Dragon Ancestor</strong></h3>
<p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.</p>
<h3><strong>Draconic Ancestory</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Dragon</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Damage Type</strong></p>
<p>Black &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Acid<br />Blue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lightning<br />Brass &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fire<br />Bronze &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning<br />Copper &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Acid<br />Gold &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fire<br />Green &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poison<br />Red &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fire<br />Silver &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cold<br />White &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cold</p>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</p>
<h3><strong>Draconic Resilience</strong></h3>
<p>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren&rsquo;t w earing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<h3><strong>Elemental Affinity</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.</p>
<h3><strong>Dragon Wings</strong></h3>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. You can&rsquo;t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.</p>
<h3><strong>Dragon Presence</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you w ere casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Sorcerer\">Sorcerer</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
<h3><strong>Wild Magic Surge</strong></h3>
<p>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect.</p>
<h3><strong>Tides of Chaos</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.</p>
<h3><strong>Bend Luck</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature&rsquo;s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.</p>
<h3><strong>Controlled Chaos</strong></h3>
<p>At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.</p>
<h3><strong>Spell Bombardment</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.</p>

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Warlock\">Warlock</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being&rsquo;s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges.</p>
<h3><strong>Expanded Spell List</strong></h3>
<p>The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of<br />spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following<br />spells are added to the Warlock Spell List for you.</p>

<h3><strong>Fey Presence</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.<br />Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3><strong>Misty Escape</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.</p>
<h3><strong>Beguiling Defenses</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
<h3><strong>Dark Delirium</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC&gt; On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.<br />Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.<br />You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>",

<h3><strong>Dark One&rsquo;s Luck</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d 10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll&rsquo;s effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3><strong>Fiendish Resilience</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical w eapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p>
<h3><strong>Hurl Through Hell</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

<h3><strong>Awakened Mind</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don&rsquo;t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p>
<h3><strong>Entropic Ward</strong></h3>
<p>At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy&rsquo;s failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3><strong>Thought Shield</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can&rsquo;t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.</p>
<h3><strong>Create Thrall</strong></h3>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid&rsquo;s mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a remove curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Wizard\">Wizard</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation. Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.</p>
<h3><strong>Abjuration Savant</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3><strong>Arcane Ward</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell&rsquo;s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your w izard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can&rsquo;t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can&rsquo;t create it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h3><strong>Projected Ward</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.</p>
<h3><strong>Improved Abjuration</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.</p>
<h3><strong>Spell Resistance</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.</p>",

As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.</p>
<h3><strong>Conjuration Savant</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3><strong>Minor Conjuration</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.</p>
<h3><strong>Benign Transposition</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.</p>
<h3><strong>Focused Conjuration</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can&rsquo;t be broken as a result of taking damage.</p>
<h3><strong>Durable Summons</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.</p>",

You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<h3><strong>Expert Divination</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell o f 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can&rsquo;t be higher than 5th level.</p>
<h3><strong>The Third Eye</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can&rsquo;t use the feature again until you finish a rest. <br /><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8. <br /><em><strong>Ethereal Sight.</strong></em> You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you. <br /><em><strong>Greater Comprehension.</strong></em> You can read any language. <br /><em><strong>See Invisibility.</strong></em> You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Portent</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind o f what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Wizard\">Wizard</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers w ho bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants w ho magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.</p>
<h3><strong>Enchantment Savant</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3><strong>Hypnotic Gaze</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. A s an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature&rsquo;s speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h3><strong>Instinctive Charm</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack&rsquo;s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can&rsquo;t be charmed are immune to this effect.</p>
<h3><strong>Split Enchantment</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.</p>
<h3><strong>Alter Memories</strong></h3>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature&rsquo;s understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed. Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can&rsquo;t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Wizard\">Wizard</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>
<h3><strong>Evocation Savant</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3><strong>Sculpt Spells</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>
<h3><strong>Potent Cantrip</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip&rsquo;s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
<h3><strong>Empowered Evocation</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>
<h3><strong>Overchannel</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Wizard\">Wizard</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists&mdash;including many gnome wizards&mdash;are benign tricksters w ho use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</p>
<h3><strong>Illusion Savant</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3><strong>Improved Minor Illusion</strong></h3>
<p>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.</p>
<h3><strong>Malleable Illusions</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell&rsquo;s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.</p>
<h3><strong>Illusory Self</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3><strong>Illusory Reality</strong></h3>
<p>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross. The object can&rsquo;t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Wizard\">Wizard</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical&nbsp;power you can manipulate.<br />Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</p>
<h3><strong>Necromancy Savant</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3><strong>Grim Harvest</strong></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell&rsquo;s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don&rsquo;t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.</p>
<h3><strong>Undead Thralls</strong></h3>
<p>At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast animate dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.<br />Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:<br />&bull; The creature&rsquo;s hit point maximum is increased by an<br />amount equal to your wizard level.<br />&bull; The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its<br />weapon damage rolls.</p>
<h3><strong>Inured to Undeath</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can&rsquo;t be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.</p>
<h3><strong>Command Undead</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again. Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it<br />succeeds and breaks free.</p>",

"full_text": "<h1>School of Transmutation</h1>
<p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://class.com/Wizard\">Wizard</a>&nbsp;for the class description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality&rsquo;s forge. Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</p>
<h3><strong>Transmutation Savant</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3><strong>Minor Alchemy</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you w ere concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</p>
<h3><strong>Transmuter&rsquo;s Stone</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter&rsquo;s stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature&rsquo;s possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options: <br />&bull; Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8 <br />&bull; An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered <br />&bull; Proficiency in Constitution saving throws <br />&bull; Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)</p>
<p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter&rsquo;s stone, the previous one ceases to function.</p>
<h3><strong>Shapechanger</strong></h3>
<p>At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast w hose challenge rating is 1 or lower. Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.</p>
<h3><strong>Master Transmutation</strong></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter&rsquo;s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter&rsquo;s stone is destroyed and can&rsquo;t be remade until you finish a long rest. <br /><em><strong>Major Transformation.</strong></em> You can transmute one nonmagical object&mdash;no larger than a 5-foot cube&mdash;into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and o f equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it. <br /><em><strong>Panacea.</strong></em> You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter&rsquo;s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points. <br /><em><strong>Restore Life.</strong></em> You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter&rsquo;s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook. <br /><em><strong>Restore Youth.</strong></em> You touch the transmuter&rsquo;s stone to a willing creature, and that creature&rsquo;s apparent age is reduced by 3 d 10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn&rsquo;t extend the creature&rsquo;s lifespan.</p>",
