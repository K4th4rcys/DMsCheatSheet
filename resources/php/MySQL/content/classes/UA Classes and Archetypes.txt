Among elves, Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors. These archers stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows<br />to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Arcane Arrow<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to channel magic into your attacks with a longbow or shortbow.</span></p><p><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Create Magic Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>As a bonus action on your turn, you can create one magic arrow in your hand. The arrow lasts until the end of the turn or until it hits or misses a target. You can fire the arrow from a shortbow or longbow. The &nbsp;arrow is a magic weapon that deals an additional 2d6 force damage on a hit. You have two uses of this feature, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Arcane Shot.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see the Arcane Shots section below).

You learn to understand magical theory and develop survival skills for wandering the wilds. You gain proficiency in two of the following <br />skills of your choice: Arcana, Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Conjure Arrows<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>At 7th level, you learn a minor but useful magical trick. As an action, you can conjure 20 nonmagical arrows. The arrows appear in your hand or in a container, such as a quiver, on your body. The arrows remain for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again; they then vanish.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Ever-Ready Arrow<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Starting at 15th level, you can conjure forth a magic-infused arrow more often than before.

The options are presented here in alphabetical order.

Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. If the arrow hits the target, the target can&rsquo;t attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the end of your next turn. The target ignores this effect if it is immune to the charmed condition. This effect also ends if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Brute Bane Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. If a creature is hit by the arrow, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage dealt by the creature&rsquo;s attacks is halved until the end of your next turn.</span><br /><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Bursting Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>You imbue your arrow with a blast of force energy drawn from the school of evocation. If you hit a creature with this arrow, each creature within 10 feet of it takes 2d6 force damage.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Defending Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>You use abjuration magic to weave a charm that disrupts your enemy&rsquo;s magic. A creature hit by this arrow suffers disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Grasping Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, thorny brambles that wrap around the target. The target hit by the arrow takes a &ndash;10 penalty to speed, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage if it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can touch it can use <br />its action to try to remove the brambles, which requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Piercing Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>You use transmutation magic to transform your arrow into an ethereal dart that passes through its targets. When you attack with this arrow, it fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long. You make a separate attack using your Arcane Arrow against each creature in that line.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Seeking Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. As an action, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute, and make a ranged attack against it, using the Arcane Arrow. The arrow flies around corners if <br />necessary, and this attack ignores three-quarters cover, half cover, and disadvantage caused by the target being out of sight or being at long range. The attack automatically misses if the target is out of the weapon&rsquo;s range or if there is no path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target. If the arrow hits its target, you know it, but you don&rsquo;t learn the target&rsquo;s location unless it&rsquo;s within your line of sight.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle2'><strong>Shadow Arrow.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe&rsquo;s vision with grasping shadows. Until the end of your next turn, the target hit by the arrow can&rsquo;t see more than 30 feet away.</span></p>','reference':'Usergen','class_skills':'','proficiencies':''},

{'id':5697,'name':'Bard, College of Satire','type':'archetype','hit_die':'','alignment':'Any','full_text':'<h1><span class='fontstyle0'>College of Satire</span></h1><hr /><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king&rsquo;s royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand&rsquo;s affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm&rsquo;s cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh. While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester&rsquo;s barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth. For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester&rsquo;s satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her. Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist&rsquo;s treachery or exposing a baron&rsquo;s plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm. Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies&rsquo; spirits while casting doubt into foes&rsquo; minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Bonus Proficiencies<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>When you join the College of Satire at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves&rsquo; tools.

At 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration after you fail an ability check, fail a saving throw, or miss with an attack roll. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one. If using this ability grants you a success on the attack, saving throw, or ability check, note the number you rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die. The DM can then apply that result as a penalty to an attack or check you make, and you cannot use this ability again until you suffer this drawback. When the DM invokes this penalty, describe an embarrassing gaffe or mistake you make as part of the affected die roll.</span> </p>','reference':'Usergen','class_skills':'','proficiencies':''},

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Channel Divinity: Spirits of the City <br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to call on the city for aid. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any city utility within 30 feet of you either works perfectly or shuts down entirely for 1 minute <br />(your choice). Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw.&nbsp;</span><span class='fontstyle0'>On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone or restrained (your choice by hazards such as entangling wires, high pressure water erupting from fire hydrants, pavement collapsing to unseen potholes, and so on.

If the targeted device is held or otherwise actively used by a living creature, that creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the targeted device ceases to function until the end of your next turn.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC as a techno-organic virus quickly spreads through its body. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, you can use an action to issue it a single command, as if you were casting the </span><span class='fontstyle1'><em>command</em>&nbsp;</span><span class='fontstyle0'>spell. The target makes its saving throw against your command with disadvantage. You can issue this command at any time while the target remains infected.

The mariner&rsquo;s AC bonus comes with conditions, but it plays into the restrictions a mariner must observe to gain a swimming or climbing speed. In addition, a shipu2010based campaign lends itself to fighters who wield scimitars (representing a cutlass) and a dagger, and who wear light armor.

In return for your patron&rsquo;s gifts, you wander the world seeking lore that you can share with the Seeker. Your patron could be any deity or other powerful entity dedicated to knowledge or forgotten lore. Celestian is an ideal patron for a Greyhawk campaign, and was the inspiration for this concept. In the Forgotten Realms, your patron might be Azuth or Oghma.

Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Pact Boon: Pact of the Star Chain<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>At 3rd level, a character dedicated to the Seeker can select this option instead of one of the warlock&rsquo;s existing Pact Boon options. The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated with seven gleaming motes of brightness. While the chain is on your person, you know the </span><span class='fontstyle5'><em>augury</em> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of spells known.<br />Additionally, you can invoke the Seeker&rsquo;s power to gain advantage on an Intelligence check while you carry this item. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.<br />If you lose your Star Chain, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from the Seeker. The ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous chain.

You employ that Channel Divinity option by using your Channel Arcana ability. When you use your Channel Arcana, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Arcana again. Some Channel Arcana effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect, the save DC equals your wizard spell save DC.

The &ldquo;Rune Magic&rdquo; section below contains information on master runes and descriptions of runes and their properties. The first rune you master is the rune you found and presented to your tutor to qualify for this prestige class. Your entrance to the class includes the process of mastering that rune&rsquo;s secrets.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Runic Magic<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Runes can make use of your own magical power to augment some of their effects. You gain a number of spell slots as specified on the Rune Scribe table, but this prestige class does not grant spells known. Instead, as a rune scribe, you can expend your spell slots to empower runes, as described in the &ldquo;Rune Magic&rdquo; section below.<br />For the purpose of multiclassing, to determine your total spell slots, add your levels in rune scribe to your levels in classes that grant you the Spellcasting feature. For example, if you are a rune scribe 4/wizard 6, you would have the spell slots of a 10th-level character, in addition to having the cantrips and spellbook of a 6th-level wizard.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Runic Discovery<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Your continuing study of runic magic allows you to recreate the secrets of new runes without first needing to uncover them. At 2nd, 3rd, and 5th level, choose a rare rune. You can attune to that rune even if you do not possess the master rune for it. (See the &ldquo;Rune Magic&rdquo; section below for information on rune rarity and master runes.) In order to attune to a rune in this manner, you must spend a short rest doing nothing but meditating on the rune. At the end of the short rest, you are attuned to the rune. You are considered to always have the rune on your person for the purpose of determining whether you can use its features.<br />You can spend another short rest doing nothing but meditating on the rune to end your attunement to it. <br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Living Rune<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Runes are a part of the living world, and your studies allow you to connect to their magic in increasingly powerful ways. At 4th level, you learn to incorporate rune magic into your identity, allowing you to augment your body and mind. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to increase one ability score of your choice by 2 or increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. At the end of each subsequent long rest, you can alter this choice, reducing the scores you previously increased and improving different scores. (If you chose to increase two abilities, you can opt to alter only one of those choices.)<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Rune Mastery<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>At 5th level, you attain the ability to master an ever-greater range of runic magic. When you attune to a rune, you can choose to have it not count toward your limit of attuned magic items. You can be attuned to only one such rune in this manner at a time. You can use this ability again after you end your attunement to a rune.</span></p><hr /><h1><span class='fontstyle0'>Rune Magic<br /></span></h1><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Rune magic allows a character to unlock the power contained within magical symbols and sigils. Not every such mark has the potential for power. Only those runes forged in the ancient days of creation still resonate with the fundamental magic of the world. Runes work much like magic items. You can discover them, attune to them, and use their magic in a variety of ways. However, unlike with magic items, only a rune scribe can use all the benefits a rune offers.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Overview<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Runes are powerful icons that you can use for a variety of effects. In order to use a rune, you must normally find and keep a </span><span class='fontstyle2'>master rune</span><span class='fontstyle0'>. A master rune is a rare object&mdash;a gem or carved rock, a magical token, a shard of some special material, and so on&mdash;engraved with the rune and empowered with magic that allows you to unleash&nbsp;</span><span class='fontstyle0'>the rune&rsquo;s effects. Those effects are divided into two categories.&nbsp;</span><span class='fontstyle2'>Simple properties </span><span class='fontstyle0'>are usable by anyone who attunes to a master rune.&nbsp;</span><span class='fontstyle2'>Complex properties </span><span class='fontstyle0'>are usable only by a character who attunes to a master rune and who possesses the Rune Lore class feature. Unless otherwise noted, you must have a master rune on your person in order to use its properties.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Finding Runes<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>A rune found as treasure is a master rune, carefully scribed into a rare object and available for use as a training tool to allow would-be rune scribes to unlock its power. Each rune discussed below is detailed as part of a master rune. Master runes and the runes they contain are treated much like magic items. They are categorized in rarity from rare to legendary, and can be placed in a campaign whenever the DM opts to place treasure. There are no common or uncommon runes.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Buying and Selling Runes<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Treat a master rune as a magic item of its equivalent rarity for the purpose of buying and selling in the campaign. Just as with other magic items, the DM will determine whether such items are available to purchase in the campaign and under what conditions.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Identifying Runes<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Runes are identified in a manner similar to magic items. Simply handling a master rune causes a strong sense of its rune&rsquo;s identity to echo in a character&rsquo;s mind. For example, touching a master rune item containing the </span><span class='fontstyle4'>kalt </span><span class='fontstyle0'>rune (the rune of cold) might cause you to experience a sudden chill as visions of snow and ice flash through your mind. The </span><span class='fontstyle4'>identify </span><span class='fontstyle0'>spell immediately reveals a master rune&rsquo;s simple properties. You can also learn its simple properties over the course of a short rest while maintaining physical contact with the rune.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Runes and Attunement<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>A rune always requires attunement to use its simple properties. Attuning to a master rune requires you to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This can&rsquo;t be the same short rest used to learn the rune&rsquo;s properties. This focus takes the form of carefully and repeatedly copying the rune, whether with ink and parchment or simply scribing it into the dirt. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, you gain an intuitive understanding of how to activate the rune&rsquo;s magical properties. A master rune can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and all runes count toward your <br />limit of magic items you can attune to. Any attempt to attune to a fourth magic item or rune fails (though a rune scribe&rsquo;s Rune Mastery feature allows attunement to one additional rune). You cannot attune to more than one copy of a rune. You can end attunement to a rune in the same manner as with any other magic item.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>','reference':'Usergen','class_skills':'','proficiencies':'Calligrapher's, mason's, woodcarver's'},

At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice (see the talent options later in this class description). You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Talents Known column of the Mystic table.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Psionic Disciplines<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. Such disciplines are divided into two categories: lesser disciplines and greater disciplines. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.<br />At 1st level, you know two lesser disciplines of your choice (see the discipline options later in this class description). You learn additional disciplines of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table. You must be at least 5th level to learn a greater discipline.<br />In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice. You can replace a lesser discipline with a greater discipline, but only if you are at least 5th level.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Psi Points<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to the psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points. The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum after you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can&rsquo;t go below 0 or over your maximum.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Psi Limit<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Psychic Focus<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>You can focus psychic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline&rsquo;s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a psychic focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time.</span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Psionic Ability<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.<br /></span></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'><strong><span class='fontstyle1'>Discipline save DC </span></strong><span class='fontstyle0'><strong>=</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br /></span><strong><span class='fontstyle1'>Discipline attack modifier </span></strong><span class='fontstyle0'><strong>=</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Mystic Order<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>At 1st level, you choose a Mystic Order: the Order of the Awakened or the Order of the Immortal, both detailed at the end of the class description. Each order specializes in a particular approach topsionics. Your order gives you features when you choose it at 1st level and additional features at 3rd, 6th, and 8th level.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Mystical Recovery<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Starting at 2nd level, you draw vigor from the psi energy you use to power psionic disciplines associated with your Mystic Order.<br />Whenever you spend psi points on a psionic discipline of your order, you regain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier if your current hit point total equals half your hit point maximum or less.</span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Ability Score Improvement<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th level,&nbsp;you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Strength of Mind<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Even the simplest psionic techniques require a deep understanding of how psionic energy can augment mind and body. This understanding allows you to alter your defenses to better deal with threats.<br />Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Consumptive Power<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>At 10th level, you gain the ability to sacrifice your health in exchange for psychic power. As a bonus action, you regain up to 5 psi points. For each point you choose to regain this way, your current hit points and hit point maximum are both reduced by 1 for each level you have in this class. This reduction can&rsquo;t be lessened in any way.<br />Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Mystic Orders<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Psionics is a mysterious form of power within most D&amp;D worlds. Secretive orders study its origins and applications, while pushing the boundaries of what psychic power can achieve. Each mystic order pursues a specific goal for psionic power. That goal shapes how the members of an order understand psionics and determines the disciplines they master.<br /></span></p><h1>Psionic Disciplines</h1><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Psionic disciplines are the heart of a mystic&rsquo;s craft. They are the mental exercises and psychic formulae used to forge inner will into tangible effects.<br />Disciplines were each discovered by different orders and tend to reflect their creators&rsquo; ethos and specialties. However, a mystic may learn any discipline regardless of its associated order.</span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Using a Discipline<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Each discipline has a number of ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points needed to use its effect options. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.<br />The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Psychic Focus<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Effect Options and Psi Points<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don&rsquo;t have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can&rsquo;t use the option.<br />Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit.<br />Each option notes specific information about its effect, including the action required to use it (if any), its range, and whether it requires concentration. If an option doesn&rsquo;t state that it is used as an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, using it requires no action.</span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Components<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Disciplines don&rsquo;t require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Duration<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>An option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.<br /></span></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'><span class='fontstyle7'><strong>Instantaneous.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>If no duration is specified, the effect of an option is instantaneous.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle7'><strong>Concentration.</strong> </span><span class='fontstyle0'>Some effect options require concentration. This requirement is noted with a &ldquo;C&rdquo; after the option&rsquo;s psi point cost.<br /></span></p><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can&rsquo;t concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Targets and Areas of Effect<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect. See chapter 10, &ldquo;Spellcasting,&rdquo; of the </span><span class='fontstyle4'>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</span><span class='fontstyle0'>.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.<br />Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline&rsquo;s effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.<br /></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'>Combining Psionic Effects<br /></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of those disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a single psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn&rsquo;t combine with itself if that option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect&mdash;usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect&mdash;applies while the durations of the effects overlap. <br />Psionics and magic are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule (see &ldquo;Psionics and Magic&rdquo; earlier, as well as &ldquo;Combining Magical Effects&rdquo; in chapter 10, &ldquo;Spellcasting,&rdquo; of the </span><span class='fontstyle4'>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</span><span class='fontstyle0'>).</span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Psionic Talents</span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>A psionic talent is a psychic ability that requires psionic aptitude but doesn&rsquo;t drain a mystic&rsquo;s psionic energy. Talents are similar to disciplines and use the same rules, but with three important exceptions:<br /></span></span></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle3'>&bull; </span><span class='fontstyle0'>You can never use your psychic focus on a talent.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle3'>&bull; </span><span class='fontstyle0'>Talents don&rsquo;t require you to spend psi points to use them.<br /></span><span class='fontstyle3'>&bull; </span><span class='fontstyle0'>Talents aren&rsquo;t linked to psionic orders.<br /></span></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>Beacon<br /></span></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle4'><em>Psionic talent</em><br /></span><span class='fontstyle0'>As a bonus action, you cause bright light to radiate from your body in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. The light lasts for 1 hour, and you can extinguish it as a bonus action.<br /></span></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>Blade Meld<br /></span></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle4'><em>Psionic talent</em><br /></span><span class='fontstyle0'>As an action, you cause one simple or martial melee weapon you are holding to dissolve into your body. This process is harmless to you and the weapon. Until the weapon reappears, it is inaccessible, as are any of its properties. You can have only one weapon at a time affected in this way. You can summon the weapon to your hand as a bonus action. It reappears in your space if you are unconscious or dead.</span><br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>Light Step<br /></span></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle4'><em>Psionic talent</em><br /></span><span class='fontstyle0'>As a bonus action, you alter your density and weight to improve your mobility. For the rest of your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and the next time you stand up, you need to spend no more than 10 feet of movement to do so.<br /></span></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>Mind Meld<br /></span></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle4'><em>Psionic talent</em><br /></span><span class='fontstyle0'>As a bonus action, you can communicate telepathically with one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. You don&rsquo;t need to share a language with a creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, and the creature understands you even if it lacks a language. You can allow a creature to respond to you telepathically, but it must <br />understand at least one language in order to communicate this way. This ability to communicate lasts until the start of your next turn. You can&rsquo;t communicate with an unwilling creature.<br /></span></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>Mind Thrust<br /></span></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle4'><em>Psionic talent</em><br /></span><span class='fontstyle0'>As an action, you blast psychic energy at one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the target takes any of this damage, you can push it up to 10 feet away from you. The talent&rsquo;s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).<br /></span></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>Thought Spear<br /></span></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle4'><em>Psionic talent</em><br /></span><span class='fontstyle0'>As an action, you psychically strike one creature that you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage. The talent&rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8 when you <br />reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).<br /></span></span></p><h3><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle0'>Night Eyes<br /></span></span></h3><p><span class='fontstyle0'><span class='fontstyle4'><em>Psionic talent</em><br /></span><span class='fontstyle0'>As an action, you grant yourself darkvision with a range of 30 feet.

If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object&rsquo;s point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object, regardless of how long ago it was last handled.<br />You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past 24 hours. The events you perceive unfold from the object&rsquo;s perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can&rsquo;t use other senses.<br />Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object&rsquo;s location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object&rsquo;s surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.<br /></span></p><h2><span class='fontstyle0'>Psychic Surge<br /></span></h2><p><span class='fontstyle0'>Starting at 6th level, you overload your psychic focus to batter down an opponent&rsquo;s defenses.
