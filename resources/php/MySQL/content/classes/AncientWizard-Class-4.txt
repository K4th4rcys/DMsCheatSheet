<p>See&nbsp;<a title=\"Wizard\" href=\"http:\/\/class.com\/wizard\">Wizard<\/a>&nbsp;for the full class description.<\/p>
<p><em>Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. &nbsp;It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. &nbsp;The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. &nbsp;The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. &nbsp;Some savants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single school of magic, seeing them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic. &nbsp;Other savants are generous teachers, countering ignorance and deception with deep knowledge and good humor.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Lore Master<\/h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting at 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. &nbsp;Your&nbsp;<\/span>proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skill if you are proficient in that skill.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, rather than physical agility. &nbsp;When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).<\/p>
<h3>Spell Secrets<\/h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 2nd level, you master the first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies.<\/span><\/p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning,&nbsp;<\/span>necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). &nbsp;You replace one energy type for another by altering the spell&rsquo;s formula as you cast it.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. &nbsp;Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p><h4>Altering Spells<\/h4><h5><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;While the Spell Secrets feature offers increased versatility, at the table its effects can be difficult to spot by the other players. &nbsp;If you're playing a savant, take a moment to describe how you alter your spells. &nbsp;Think of a signature change your character is particularly proud of. &nbsp;Be inventive, and make the game more fun for everyone by playing up the sudden, unexpected tricks your character can employ. &nbsp;For example, a fireball transformed to require a Strength save might become a sphere of burning rock that shatters and slams into its target. &nbsp;A charm person that requires a Constitution save might take the form of a vaporous narcotic that alters the target's mood.<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>
<h3>Alchemical Casting<\/h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 6th level, you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. &nbsp;When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic into your spell to amplify it. &nbsp;The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.<\/span><\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spell&rsquo;s raw force. &nbsp;If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. &nbsp;If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spell&rsquo;s range. &nbsp;If the spell&rsquo;s range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An additional 3rd-level spell slot can increase the spell&rsquo;s potency. Increase the spell&rsquo;s save DC by 2.<\/p>
<h3>Prodigious Memory<\/h3>
<p>At 10th level, you have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation. &nbsp;As a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spellbook. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Master of Magic<\/h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 14th level, your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spell. &nbsp;As a bonus action, you can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of your choice from any class&rsquo;s spell list. &nbsp;The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn&rsquo;t have it prepared, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. &nbsp;If the spell isn&rsquo;t a wizard spell, it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. &nbsp;The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your&nbsp;<\/span>mind when you cast it or when the current turn ends.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.<\/p>",

<p><em>You have made your pact with a powerful, sentient magic weapon carved from the stuff of the Shadowfell. &nbsp;The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, several of which have spread across the multiverse over the ages. &nbsp;These weapons grow stronger as they consume the life essence of their victims. &nbsp;The strongest of them can use their ties to the Shadowfell to offer power to mortals who serve them. &nbsp;The Raven Queen forged the first of these weapons. &nbsp;They, along with the hexblade warlocks, are another tool she can use to manipulate events in the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Expanded Spell List<\/h3>
<p>The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. &nbsp;The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.<\/p><h4>Hexblade Expanded Spells<\/h4><table style=\"height: 138px;\" width=\"418\"><tbody><tr style=\"text-align: center;\"><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spell Level<\/strong><\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spells<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1st<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Shield\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/shield\">Shield<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Wrathful Smite\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/wrathful smite\">Wrathful Smite<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">2nd<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a title=\"Branding Smite\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/branding smite\">Branding Smite<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Magic Weapon\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/magic weapon\">Magic Weapon<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">3rd<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a title=\"Blink\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/blink\">Blink<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Elemental Weapon\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/elemental weapon\">Elemental Weapon<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">4th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Phantasmal Killer\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/phantasmal killer\">Phantasmal Killer<\/a>, <a title=\"Staggering Smite\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/staggering smite\">Staggering Smite<\/a>&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">5th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a title=\"Cone of Cold\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/cone of cold\">Cone of Cold<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Destructive Wave\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/destructive wave\">Destructive Wave<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>
<p>&nbsp;<\/p>
<h3>Hex Warrior<\/h3>
<p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. &nbsp;In addition, when attacking with a melee weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the twohanded property, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.<\/p>
<h3>Hexblade's Curse<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on an enemy. &nbsp;As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. &nbsp;The target is cursed for 1 minute. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:<\/p>
<p>&bull; You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.<\/p>
<p>&bull; Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.<\/p>
<p>&bull; If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Shadow Hound<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your shadow can split from you and transform into a hound of pure darkness. &nbsp;Most of the time, your shadow hound masquerades as your normal shadow. &nbsp;As a bonus action, you can command it to magically slip into the shadow of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. &nbsp;While the shadow hound is merged in this manner, the target can&rsquo;t gain the benefits of half cover or three-quarters cover against your attack rolls, and you know the distance and direction to the target even if it is hidden. &nbsp;The hound can&rsquo;t be seen by anyone but you and those with truesight, and it is unaffected by light. &nbsp;The target has a vague feeling of dread while the hound is present.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As a bonus action, you can command your shadow hound to return to you. &nbsp;It also automatically returns to you if you and the target are on different planes of existence, if you&rsquo;re incapacitated, or if <a title=\"Dispel Magic\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/dispel magic\">Dispel Magic<\/a>, <a title=\"Remove Curse\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/remove curse\">Remove Curse<\/a>, or similar magic is used on the target.<\/p>
<h3>Armor of Hexes<\/h3>
<p>At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. &nbsp;If the target cursed by your Hexblade&rsquo;s Curse hits you with an attack roll, roll a d6. &nbsp;On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you.<\/p>
<h3>Master of Hexes<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your Hexblade&rsquo;s Curse again without resting, but when you apply it to a new target, the curse immediately ends on the previous target.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Hexblade Exclussive Invocations<\/h2><h4>Burning Hex<\/h4><div><em>Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron<\/em><\/div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;As a bonus action, you cause a target cursed by your Hexblade&rsquo;s Curse to take fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).<\/div><h4>Chilling Hex<\/h4><div><em>Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron<\/em><\/div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;As a bonus action, you cause frost to swirl around a target cursed by your Hexblade&rsquo;s Curse, dealing cold damage to each of your enemies within 5 feet of the target. &nbsp;The cold damage equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).<\/div><h4>Curse Bringer<\/h4><div><em>Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron, Pact of the Blade feature<\/em><\/div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can create a greatsword forged from silver, with black runes etched into its blade, using your Pact of the Blade feature. &nbsp;If you reduce a target cursed by your Hexblade&rsquo;s Curse to 0 hit points with this sword, you can immediately change the target of the curse to a different creature. &nbsp;This change doesn&rsquo;t extend the curse&rsquo;s duration.<\/div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 slashing damage to the target per spell level, and you can reduce the creature&rsquo;s speed to 0 feet until the end of your next turn.<\/div><h4>Relentless Hex<\/h4><div><em>Prerequisite: The Hexblade patron<\/em><\/div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your Hexblade&rsquo;s Curse creates a temporary bond between you and your target. &nbsp;As a bonus action, you can magically teleport to a space you can see within 5 feet of the target cursed by your Hexblade&rsquo;s Curse. &nbsp;To do so, you must be able to see the target and must be within 30 feet of it.<\/div>",

<p><em>Your patron is the Raven Queen, a mysterious being who rules the Shadowfell from a palace of ice deep within that dread realm. &nbsp;The Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature&rsquo;s death and ensuring that it meets its end at the proscribed time and place. &nbsp;As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. &nbsp;Her ability to reach into the world is limited. &nbsp;Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. &nbsp;Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Raven Queen&rsquo;s followers are expected to serve her will in the world. &nbsp;She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality. &nbsp;She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.<\/em><\/p>

<h3>Sentinel Raven<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. &nbsp;The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to Wisdom (Perception) checks. &nbsp;The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. &nbsp;While perched on your shoulder, the raven can&rsquo;t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can&rsquo;t take damage; and it is incapacitated.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can see through the raven&rsquo;s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. &nbsp;If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The raven doesn&rsquo;t require sleep. &nbsp;While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you&mdash;no matter where it is or whether it died&mdash;and it reappears within 5 feet of you.<\/p>
<h3>Soul of the Raven<\/h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit. &nbsp;As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder, your body merges with your raven&rsquo;s form. &nbsp;While merged, you become Tiny, you replace your speed with the raven&rsquo;s, and you can use your action only to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, or Search. &nbsp;During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven being perched on your shoulder. &nbsp;As an action, you and the raven return to normal.<\/p>
<h3>Raven's Shield<\/h3>
<p>At 10th level, the Raven Queen grants you a protective blessing. &nbsp;You gain advantage on death saving throws, immunity to the frightened condition, and resistance to necrotic damage.<\/p>
<h3>Queen's Right Hand<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can channel the Raven Queen&rsquo;s power to slay a creature. &nbsp;You can cast <a title=\"Finger of Death\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/finger of death\">Finger of Death<\/a>. &nbsp;After you cast the spell with this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.<\/p>

<h3><br \/>Fey Presence<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Misty Escape<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. &nbsp;When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. &nbsp;You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.<\/p>
<h3>Beguiling Defense<\/h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. &nbsp;You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. &nbsp;The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage<\/p>
<h3>Dark Delirium<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. &nbsp;As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. &nbsp;It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. &nbsp;On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). &nbsp;This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. &nbsp;The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.<\/p>

<h3>Dark One's Luck<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. &nbsp;When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d 10 to your roll. &nbsp;You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll&rsquo;s effects occur. &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Fiendish Resilience<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. &nbsp;You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. &nbsp;Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.<\/p>
<h3>Hurl Through Hell<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level,&nbsp;when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. &nbsp;The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. &nbsp;If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.&nbsp;<\/p>

<p>Starting at 1st level,&nbsp;your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. &nbsp;You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.<\/p>
<h3>Entropic Ward<\/h3>
<p>At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy&rsquo;s failed strike into good luck for yourself. &nbsp;When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. &nbsp;If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Thought Shield<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can&rsquo;t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. &nbsp;You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.<\/p>
<h3>Create Thrall<\/h3>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid&rsquo;s mind with the alien magic of your patron. &nbsp;You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. &nbsp;That creature is then charmed by you until a remove curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. &nbsp;You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.<\/p>

<h3><br \/>Shielding Aurora<\/h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Pact Boon: Pact of the Star Chain<\/h3>
<p>At 3rd level, a character dedicated to the Seeker can select this option instead of one of the warlock&rsquo;s existing Pact Boon options.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated with seven gleaming motes of brightness. &nbsp;While the chain is on your person, you know the <a title=\"Augury\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/augury\">Augury<\/a>&nbsp;spell and can cast it as a ritual. &nbsp;The spell doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of spells known.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you can invoke the Seeker&rsquo;s power to gain advantage on an Intelligence check while you carry this item. &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If you lose your Star Chain, you can perform a 1- hour ceremony to receive a replacement from the Seeker. &nbsp;The ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous chain. &nbsp;The chain disappears in a flash of light when you die.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The exact form of this item might be different depending on your patron. &nbsp;The Star Chain is inspired by the Greyhawk deity Celestian.<\/p>
<h3>Astral Refuge<\/h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to step into an astral refuge. &nbsp;As an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and enter the Astral Plane, taking advantage of its timeless nature. &nbsp;While in your astral refuge, you can take two actions to cast spells that target only you. &nbsp;After using those two actions, you return to the space you occupied and your turn ends.<\/p>
<h3>Far Wanderer<\/h3>
<p>At 10th level, you no longer need to breathe, and you gain resistance to fire damage and cold damage.<\/p>
<h3>Astral Sequestration<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level,&nbsp;you gain the ability to sequester yourself and your allies on the Astral Plane. &nbsp;By performing a special ritual over the course of 5 minutes, you shift yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see to the Astral Plane. &nbsp;You and those creatures gain the benefits of a short rest while sequestered on the Astral Plane. &nbsp;You then return to the spaces you all occupied when you used this ability, with no time having passed in the world.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;During this short rest, you and the creatures you sequester can make use of any options available during a rest that affect only you and the creatures you sequester.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.<\/p>

<p>See&nbsp;<a title=\"Wizard\" href=\"http:\/\/class.com\/wizard\">Wizard<\/a>&nbsp;for the full class description.<\/p>
<p><em>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. &nbsp;The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration. &nbsp;It teaches techniques that empower a caster&rsquo;s spells, while also providing methods for a wizard to bolster their own defenses.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. &nbsp;They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any flimsy piece of steel. &nbsp;War mages strike fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. &nbsp;Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents&rsquo; attempts to counterattack.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Arcane Deflection<\/h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. &nbsp;When you are hit by an attack or fail a Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.<\/p>
<h3>Tactical Wit<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your ability to quickly assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. &nbsp;You gain a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.<\/p>
<h3>Power Surge<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can empower your spells that unleash harm on groups of foes. &nbsp;When you force multiple creatures to make saving throws against the damage of one of your spells, you can increase the spell&rsquo;s damage by rolling two more of its damage dice. &nbsp;This increase occurs only on the turn you cast the spell.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Durable Magic<\/h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. &nbsp;While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.<\/p>
<h3>Deflecting Shroud<\/h3>
<p>At 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. &nbsp;When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, magical energy arcs from you; each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you takes force damage equal to half your wizard level.<\/p>",

<p>See&nbsp;<a title=\"Paladin\" href=\"http:\/\/class.com\/paladin\">Paladin<\/a>&nbsp;for the full class description.<\/p>
<p><em>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. &nbsp;Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. &nbsp;These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning them to the light, and the paladins slay them only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. &nbsp;Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. &nbsp;Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. &nbsp;Against such foes, the paladins bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. &nbsp;Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.<\/em><\/p>
<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tenets of Redemption<\/span><\/h3>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Peace.<\/strong><\/em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Violence is a weapon of last resort. &nbsp;Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Innocence.<\/strong><\/em> &nbsp;&nbsp;All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. &nbsp;By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Patience.<\/strong><\/em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Change takes time. &nbsp;Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. &nbsp;Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Wisdom.<\/strong><\/em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. &nbsp;While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. &nbsp;Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.<\/p>
<h3>Redemption&nbsp;Spells<\/h3>

<h3><br \/>Armor of Peace<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, your commitment to peace allows you to walk into the most dangerous situations unarmored. &nbsp;While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor or wielding a shield, your base AC is 16 + your Dexterity modifier.<\/p>
<h3>Warrior of Reconciliation<\/h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you foreswear the weapons of war in favor of simple tools. &nbsp;While wielding a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage, you gain a special benefit if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with that weapon and decide to spare the creature&rsquo;s life. &nbsp;Instead of falling unconscious, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. &nbsp;During that time, the charmed creature is peaceful and docile, refusing to move or to take actions or reactions, unless you command it to. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t order the creature to attack, force someone to make a saving throw, or cause damage to itself or others. &nbsp;This charmed effect ends early if you are incapacitated or if you or your companions attack the creature, deal damage to it, or force it to make a saving throw. &nbsp;When the effect ends, the creature falls unconscious if it still has 0 hit points.<\/p>
<h3>Channel Divinity<\/h3>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Emissary of Peace.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your presence with divine power. &nbsp;As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to the next Charisma (Persuasion) check you make within the next minute.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Rebuke the Violent.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke those who use violence. &nbsp;As a reaction when an enemy within 10 feet of you deals damage with a melee attack against one creature other than you, you force that attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. &nbsp;On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. &nbsp;On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.<\/p>
<h3>Aura of the Guardian<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you can shield your allies from harm at the cost of your own health. &nbsp;As a reaction when an ally within 10 feet of you takes damage, you instead magically take that damage. &nbsp;This feature doesn&rsquo;t transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage.<\/p>
<h3>Protective Spirit<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, a holy presence mends your wounds in combat. &nbsp;You regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren&rsquo;t incapacitated.<\/p>
<h3>Emissary of Redemption<\/h3>
<p>At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which gives you two benefits:<\/p>
<p>&bull; You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects).<\/p>
<p>&bull; Whenever a creature damages you, it takes damage equal to half the amount it dealt to you.<\/p>
<p>If you attack a creature, deal damage to it, or force it to make a saving throw, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.<\/p>",

<p><em>The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. &nbsp;A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant but proves frustrating to engage. &nbsp;The drunken master&rsquo;s erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats. &nbsp;Cunning warriors can see through the drunken master&rsquo;s apparent incompetence to recognize the masterful technique employed.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Drunken Technique<\/h3>
<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don&rsquo;t already have it; your martial arts technique mixes martial training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. &nbsp;You also learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry of Blows. &nbsp;Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.<\/p>
<h3>Tipsy Sway<\/h3>
<p>At 6th level, your swaying in combat becomes maddeningly unpredictable. &nbsp;As a reaction when an enemy misses you with a melee attack roll, you can cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you. &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Drunkard&rsquo;s Luck<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 11th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at just the right moment to save you from doom. &nbsp;When you make a saving throw, you can spend 1 ki point to give yourself advantage on that roll. &nbsp;You must decide to use this feature before rolling.<\/p>
<h3>Intoxicated Frenzy<\/h3>
<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. &nbsp;When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.<\/p>",

<h3><br \/>Slayer&rsquo;s Eye<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to study and unravel a creature&rsquo;s defenses. &nbsp;As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. &nbsp;You immediately learn the target&rsquo;s vulnerabilities, immunities, and resistances. &nbsp;You also learn any special effects triggered when the target takes damage, such as fire damage halting its regeneration. &nbsp;In addition, the first time each turn you hit the target with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon. &nbsp;This benefit lasts until you target a different creature with this feature or until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p><blockquote>
<h3>Extra Attack<\/h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re playing the <em>Revised Ranger<\/em> introduced in Unearthed Arcana, you also gain the Extra Attack feature. &nbsp;Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.<\/p><\/blockquote>
<h3>Supernatural Defense<\/h3>
<p>At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey&rsquo;s assaults on your mind and body. &nbsp;Whenever the target of your Slayer&rsquo;s Eye forces you to make a saving throw, add 1d6 to your roll.<\/p>
<h3>Relentless Slayer<\/h3>
<p>At 11th level, you gain the ability to foil your foe&rsquo;s ability to escape. &nbsp;Your study of folklore and arcane knowledge gives you a key insight to keep your prey cornered. &nbsp;If the target of your Slayer&rsquo;s Eye attempts to teleport, change its shape, travel to another plane of existence, or turn gaseous, you can use your reaction to make a Wisdom check contested by a Wisdom check made by the target. &nbsp;To use this ability, you must be able to see the target and need to be within 30 feet of it. &nbsp;If you succeed, you foil its attempt, causing it to waste the action, bonus action, or reaction it used.<\/p>
<h3>Slayer&rsquo;s Counter<\/h3>
<p>At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. &nbsp;If the target of your Slayer&rsquo;s Eye forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against it. &nbsp;You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. &nbsp;If the attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack&rsquo;s normal effects.<\/p>",

<p><em>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors.&nbsp; These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living.&nbsp; When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid in a time of need.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies.&nbsp; In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors&rsquo; deeds.&nbsp; These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Ancestral Protectors<\/h3>
<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage.&nbsp; These warriors distract a foe you strike and hinder its attempts to harm your companions.&nbsp; While you&rsquo;re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors.&nbsp; Until the start of your next turn or until your rage ends, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn&rsquo;t target you, and creatures other than you have resistance to the damage of the target&rsquo;s attacks.<\/p>
<h3>Spirit Shield<\/h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection for your allies.&nbsp; If you are raging and a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d8.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d8 at 10th level and by 4d8 at 14th level.<\/p>
<h3>Consult the Spirits<\/h3>
<p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits and use them to scout faroff areas.&nbsp; When you do so, you cast the clairvoyance spell, without needing a spell slot.&nbsp; Rather than creating a spherical sensor, the spell invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location.&nbsp; Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for the spell.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After you cast the spell in this way, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Vengeful Ancestors<\/h3>
<p>At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to strike foes that dare to harm those you protect.&nbsp; When you use your Spirit Shield to protect a creature damaged by an attack, the attacker takes the same amount of damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.<\/p>",

<h3>Fighting Style<\/h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.&nbsp; Choose one of the following options.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again.<\/p>
<p><em><strong> Dueling.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.<\/p>

<p><em><strong>Defensive Flourish.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; You spin your weapon in circles, creating a hypnotic display.&nbsp; You can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and adding the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.<br \/> <em><strong>Slashing Flourish.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; If the attack hits its target, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to damage each creature of your choice, other than the target, that you can see within 5 feet of you.&nbsp; The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.&nbsp;<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Mobile Flourish.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; If the attack hits its target, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.&nbsp; You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.<\/p>
<h3>Cunning Flourish<\/h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you use the Blade Flourish action on your turn.&nbsp; You can, nevertheless, still use only one Blade Flourish option when you take that action.<\/p>
<h3>Master&rsquo;s Flourish<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.<\/p>",

<p><em>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects.&nbsp; Among elves, Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors.&nbsp; These archers stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements.&nbsp; Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Magic Arrow<\/h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic.&nbsp; Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it a magic arrow, with a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls.&nbsp; The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.<\/p>
<h3>Arcane Shot<\/h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots.&nbsp; When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see the &ldquo;Arcane Shot Options&rdquo; section below).&nbsp; Once per turn when you fire a magic arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow.&nbsp; You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn&rsquo;t involve an attack roll.&nbsp; You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.&nbsp; You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.&nbsp; Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.<\/p>
<h3>Arcane Archer's Lore<\/h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature&mdash;typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition.&nbsp; You gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill.<\/p>
<h3>Curving Shot<\/h3>
<p>At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target.&nbsp; When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.<\/p>
<h3>Ever-Ready Shot<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is ever available to you when you need it most.&nbsp; If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.<\/p>
<h3>Arcane Shot Options<\/h3>
<p>The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels.&nbsp; The options are presented here in alphabetical order.&nbsp; They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.&nbsp; If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Banishing Arrow.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild.&nbsp; If the arrow hits a creature, the target must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.&nbsp; While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated.&nbsp; At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.&nbsp; After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Brute Bane Arrow.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; You weave necromantic magic into your arrow.&nbsp; If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage, and it must make a Constitution saving throw.&nbsp; On a failed save, the damage of the target&rsquo;s attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.&nbsp; The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Bursting Arrow.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; You imbue your arrow with a blast of force energy drawn from the school of evocation.&nbsp; If the arrow hits a creature, the target and each creature within 10 feet of it also take 2d6 force damage each.&nbsp; The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Grasping Arrow.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target.&nbsp; If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting.&nbsp; The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC.&nbsp; Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.&nbsp; The poison and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Mind-Scrambling Arrow.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target.&nbsp; Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target.&nbsp; If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it can&rsquo;t attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the start of your next turn.&nbsp; This effect ends early if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target.&nbsp; The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Piercing Arrow.<\/strong>&nbsp; <\/em>You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality.&nbsp; When you use this option, you don&rsquo;t make an attack roll for the attack.&nbsp; Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing.&nbsp; The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover.&nbsp; Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw.&nbsp; On a failed save, a target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage.&nbsp; On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.&nbsp; The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Seeking Arrow.<\/strong>&nbsp; <\/em>Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey.&nbsp; When you use this option, you don&rsquo;t make an attack roll for the attack.&nbsp; Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute.&nbsp; The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover.&nbsp; If the target is within the weapon&rsquo;s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw.&nbsp; On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target&rsquo;s current location.&nbsp; On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don&rsquo;t learn its location.&nbsp; The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Shadow Arrow.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe&rsquo;s vision with shadows.&nbsp; If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.&nbsp; The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<\/p>",

<p><em>Monks of the Way of Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point that the weapon becomes like an extension of the body.&nbsp; A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a painter regards a brush or a writer sees parchment, ink, and quill.&nbsp; A sword or bow is a tool used to express the beauty and elegance of the martial arts.&nbsp; That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Path of the Kensei<\/h3>
<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You gain the following benefits:<\/p>
<p>&bull; Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon.&nbsp; Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties.&nbsp; The longbow is also a valid choice.&nbsp; You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don&rsquo;t already have it.&nbsp; Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you.&nbsp; Many of this tradition&rsquo;s features work only with your kensei weapons.&nbsp; When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon&mdash;melee or ranged&mdash;to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.<\/p>
<p>&bull; If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon.&nbsp; You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren&rsquo;t incapacitated.<\/p>
<p>&bull; You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly.&nbsp; When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon&rsquo;s type.&nbsp; You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.<\/p>
<h3>One with the Blade<\/h3>
<p>At 6th level, you extend your ki into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Magic Kensei Weapons.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Precise Strike.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.&nbsp; You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.<\/p>
<h3>Sharpen the Blade<\/h3>
<p>At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki.&nbsp; As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it.&nbsp; The bonus equals the number of ki points you spent.&nbsp; This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.<\/p>
<h3>Unerring Accuracy<\/h3>
<p>At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy.&nbsp; If you make an attack roll with a monk weapon and miss, you can reroll it.&nbsp; You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.<\/p>",

<p><em>Sometimes, the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul.&nbsp; Having such a favored soul, your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being.&nbsp; Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of celestial magic.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Favored souls, with their natural magnetism and strong personalities, are often seen as threats by traditional religious hierarchies.&nbsp; As outsiders who command celestial power, these sorcerers can undermine the existing order and claim a direct tie to the divine.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a favored soul may command religious power.&nbsp; In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.<br \/><\/em><\/p>
<h3>Divine Magic<\/h3>
<p>Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the <a title=\"cleric\" href=\"http:\/\/class.com\/cleric\">cleric<\/a> class.&nbsp; When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list, in addition to the sorcerer spell list.&nbsp; You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You also learn the&nbsp;<a title=\"Cure Wounds\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/cure wounds\">Cure Wounds<\/a> spell, which doesn&rsquo;t count against your number of sorcerer spells known.<\/p>
<h3>Favored by the Gods<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny.&nbsp; If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome.&nbsp; Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Empowered Healing<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, the celestial energy coursing through you can empower your healing magic.&nbsp; Whenever you roll dice to determine the number of hit points a sorcerer spell of yours restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once.<\/p>
<h3>Angelic Form<\/h3>
<p>At 14th level, your divine essence causes you to undergo a minor physical transformation.&nbsp; Your appearance takes on an otherworldly version of one of the following qualities (your choice): beautiful, youthful, kind, or imposing.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, as a bonus action, you can manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back.&nbsp; The wings last until you&rsquo;re incapacitated or you dismiss them as a bonus action.&nbsp; While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.<\/p>
<h3>Unearthly Recovery<\/h3>
<p>At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries.&nbsp; As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.<\/p>

<p>See&nbsp;<a title=\"Druid\" href=\"http:\/\/class.com\/druid\">Druid<\/a>&nbsp;for the full class description.<\/p>
<p><em>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid.&nbsp; These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves.&nbsp; Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges.&nbsp; They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. <\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to&nbsp;seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better.&nbsp; Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.<br \/><\/em><\/p>
<h3>Speech of the Woods<\/h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan.&nbsp; In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions.&nbsp; Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past.&nbsp; This ability doesn&rsquo;t grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.<\/p>
<h3>Spirit Totem<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call forth nature spirits and use them to influence the world around you.&nbsp; As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you.&nbsp; The spirit creates an aura in a 30 - foot radius around that point.&nbsp; It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit persists for 1 minute.&nbsp; Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of the spirit&rsquo;s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.<\/p>
<p><em><strong> Bear Spirit.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance.&nbsp; Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level.&nbsp; In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Hawk Spirit.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, marking your enemies with its keen sight.&nbsp; When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit&rsquo;s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Unicorn Spirit.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby.&nbsp; You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit&rsquo;s aura.&nbsp; In addition, if you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to anyone inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.<\/p>
<h3>Mighty Summoner<\/h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to conjure forth powerful beasts and fey.&nbsp; Any beast or fey summoned or created by your spells gains two benefits:<\/p>
<p>&bull; The creature appears with more hit points&nbsp; than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.<\/p>
<p>&bull; The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.<\/p>
<h3>Guardian Spirit<\/h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic.&nbsp; When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.<\/p>
<h3>Guardian Spirit<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most de fenseless.&nbsp; If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of <a href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/Conjure Animals\">Conjure Animals<\/a>&nbsp;as if it were cast with a 9th - level spell slot.&nbsp; It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower.&nbsp; The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you.&nbsp; If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes.&nbsp; The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).<\/p>

<h3>Bonus Proficiency<\/h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: <a href=\"http:\/\/skill.com\/animal handling\">Animal Handling<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/skill.com\/history\">History<\/a>, <a title=\"Insight\" href=\"http:\/\/skill.com\/insight\">Insight<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/skill.com\/performance\">Performance<\/a>, or <a title=\"Persuasion\" href=\"http:\/\/skill.com\/persuasion\">Persuasion<\/a>.&nbsp; Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.<\/p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.<\/p>
<h3>Combat Superiority<\/h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain a set of combat abilities, referred to as maneuvers, which are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.<\/p>

<p><em><strong>Precision Attack.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die, roll it, and add it to the attack roll.&nbsp; You can use this ability before or after rolling the d20, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Trip Attack.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down.&nbsp; Roll the die, and add it to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.&nbsp; If the target is Large or smaller, it must also succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Warding Maneuver.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you or a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction if you&rsquo;re wielding a weapon or a shield.&nbsp; Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target&rsquo;s AC against that attack.&nbsp; If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack&rsquo;s damage<\/p>
<h3>Ferocious Charger<\/h3>
<p>At 7th level, you gain additional benefits when you use your Trip Attack maneuver.&nbsp; You can expend up to two superiority dice on it, adding both dice to the damage roll.&nbsp; When you spend two dice in this way, the target has disadvantage on its Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone.<\/p>
<h3>Improved Combat Superiority<\/h3>
<p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s.&nbsp; At 18th level, they turn into d12s.<\/p>
<h3>Relentless<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain one superiority die.<\/p>",

<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.<\/p><h4>Oath of Redemption&nbsp;Spells<\/h4><table style=\"height: 138px;\" width=\"418\"><tbody><tr style=\"text-align: center;\"><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Paladin Level<\/strong><\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spells<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">3rd<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Armor of Agathys\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/armor of agathys\">Armor of Agathys<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Command\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/command\">Command<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">5th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a title=\"Hold Person\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/hold person\">Hold Person<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Spiritual Weapon\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/spiritual weapon\">Spiritual Weapon<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">9th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Bestow Curse\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/bestow curse\">Bestow Curse<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Fear\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/fear\">Fear<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">13th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Dominate Beast\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/dominate beast\">Dominate Beast<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Stoneskin\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/stoneskin\">Stoneskin<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">17th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Cloudkill\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/cloudkill\">Cloudkill<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Dominate Person\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/dominate person\">Dominate Person<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>
<h3>Channel Divinity<\/h3>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Conquering Presence.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence.&nbsp; As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw.&nbsp; On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute.&nbsp; The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<\/p>
<p><em><strong>Guided Strike.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy.&nbsp; When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll.&nbsp; You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.<\/p>
<h3>Aura of the Guardian<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you&rsquo;re not incapacitated.&nbsp; The aura includes your space, extends 10 feet from you in every direction, and is blocked by total cover.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.<\/p>
<h3>Scornful Rebuke<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity.&nbsp; Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) if you&rsquo;re not incapacitated.<\/p>
<h3>Invincible Conqueror<\/h3>
<p>At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess.&nbsp; As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:<\/p>
<p>&bull; You have resistance to all damage.<\/p>
<p>&bull; When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.<\/p>
<p>&bull; Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.<\/p>",

<p><em>Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. &nbsp;You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, or unicorn or to another entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. &nbsp;Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.<\/em><\/p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. &nbsp;You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. &nbsp;At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. &nbsp;But you know that your mission is among mortals for now and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.<\/em><\/p>
<h3>Expanded Spell List<\/h3>
<p>The Celestial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. &nbsp;The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.<\/p><h4>Seeker Expanded Spells<\/h4><table style=\"height: 138px;\" width=\"418\"><tbody><tr style=\"text-align: center;\"><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spell Level<\/strong><\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spells<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">1st<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Burning Hands\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/burning hands\">Burning Hands<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Cure Wounds\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/cure wounds\">Cure Wounds<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">2nd<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a title=\"Flaming Sphere\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/flaming sphere\">Flaming Sphere<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Lesser Restoration\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/lesser restoration\">Lesser Restoration<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">3rd<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Daylight\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/daylight\">Daylight<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Revivify\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/revivify\">Revivify<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">4th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Guardian of Faith\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/guardian of faith\">Guardian of Faith<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Wall of Fire\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/wall of fire\">Wall of Fire<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">5th<\/td><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Flame Strike\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/flame strike\">Flame Strike<\/a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Greater Restoration\" href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/greater restoration\">Greater Restoration<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>
<h3><br \/>Bonus Cantrips<\/h3>
<p>At 1st level, you learn the <a href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/sacred flame\">Sacred Flame<\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http:\/\/spell.com\/light\">Light<\/a>&nbsp;cantrips. &nbsp;They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don&rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known.<\/p>
<h3>Healing Light<\/h3>
<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. &nbsp;You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. &nbsp;The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As a bonus action, you can touch a creature and heal it, spending dice from the pool. &nbsp;The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). &nbsp;Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.<\/p>
<h3>Radiant Soul<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. &nbsp;You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you add your Charisma modifier to that damage against one target of your choice.<\/p>
<h3>Celestial Resilience<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. &nbsp;These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. &nbsp;Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. &nbsp;Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.<\/p>
<h3>Searing Vengeance<\/h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to overcome grievous injuries. &nbsp;When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. &nbsp;You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up, if you so choose. &nbsp;Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.<\/p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.<\/p>",
