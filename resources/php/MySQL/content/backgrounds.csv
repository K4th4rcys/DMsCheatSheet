Bounty Hunter|Any|"<h2><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Bounty_Hunter"">Bounty Hunter</span></h2>n<p>However fine and noble the world might have seemed at first glance, once you dug a little deeper beneath the facade, a deeper truth revealed itself to you. Conflict and strife are the only real constants in ""civilized"" lands, and for you, therein lay the opportunity for profit. As a bounty hunter you had plied your trade well, offering dubious (if effective) services and skills to all manner of client for myriad reasons- superficial or otherwise. Regardless of the cause, the justification, or the moral impunity associated with locating your mark. Every job finished brought the clink of coin between your purse strings at the expense of another poor soul fated to endure consequences dire, and often foul.n</p><p>Though the time spent in this line of work has left you grim and jilted, your reputation for ruthlessness and cunning precedes you. More often than not, you found yourself sought after and petitioned to ferret a mark, never needing to eke out the work on your own. From the lowly debtor owing the wrong merchant guild, to the misguided runaway offspring of a minor noble, or the thieving murderer eluding the city guard, none could evade your dogged pursuit, and many more dared not try once your involvement was learned.n</p><p><b>Skill Proficiencies:</b> Intimidate, Deceptionn</p><p><b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> Thieves' Toolsn</p><p><b>languages:</b> Thieves' Cantn</p><p><b>Equipment:</b> Ink bottle, a set of traveler's clothes, ink pen, 5 pages of parchment, 2 hunting traps, thieves' tools, 3 trinkets from previous bounties (roll on table PHB pg. 160-161), and a belt pouch containing 10 goldn</p>n<h3><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Feature:_Names.2C_Faces.2C_and_Places"">Feature:Names, Faces, and Places</span></h3>n<p>Though many claim the role of a bounty hunter, few actually excel at the profession save those with a keen eye for observation. Among the adept are those who are truly gifted, having an almost preternatural talent for anticipating the behavior of their targeted mark. Being among their ranks, you have an uncanny ability to recall specific details of conversation and names you overhear or participate in as it relates to your bounty, or otherwise see written, even if only for a moment or two. You can also sketch out faces and general locations you've seen with accuracy, possessing exceptional recollection. In addition, you often effortlessly identify clues when tracking your bounty's movements and disposition that would be otherwise lost on lesser pursuers.n</p>n<h3><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Feature:_Contacts_and_Forgery"">Feature:Contacts and Forgery</span></h3>n<p>As a bounty hunter you have traveled far and wide which has allowed you to have built up a network of contacts and informants that can help you track down your mark. If you are in a town or city where one of your contacts or informants reside (DM's discretion) you may inquire about information that pertains to your mark for the right price or trade a favor to gain the information (DM's discretion). Additionally you have trained yourself in creating documents that will allow you to gain entry into areas you would normally not be allowed to enter in order to capture your mark. You can forge documents including officials papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or handwriting you are trying to copy.n</p>n<h3><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Feature:_Ear_to_the_Ground"">Feature:Ear to the Ground</span></h3>n<p>You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen mark moves through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people, places and the political standings of the local area.n</p>n<h3><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Suggested_Characteristics"">Suggested Characteristics</span></h3>n<p>A bounty hunter's sole purpose is to hunt down people with a price on their head, for grievances ranging from the mundane to the terrible.

Vigilantes are as often soldiers dumbstruck by newly-found social decay and corruption whence they return home from war, as they are wealthy citizens with a penchant for martial prowess an and axe to grind against their city's seedy underbelly for a past, personal transgression. As a matter of course, a particularly zealous vigilante may come into conflict with a bounty hunter, deeming her as guilty of violating the law as any brigand skulking about an alleyway. If you indeed wish to be a vigilante, select the Crime Doesn't Pay feature outlined below instead of the Names, Faces, & Places feature above. Living a life of vigilantism means that you will always be on the lookout for criminal activity, especially so if you're within the boundaries of a town or other settlement you claim as your home. The promise of payment never sways your decisions in whom you target, and you hold yourself to a higher code than your capricious counterparts - you consider it preferable to turn your marks over to the appropriate authorities instead of harming them.n</p><p>City guard and militia are likely to turn a blind eye to your unsanctioned activities unless you cross someone in their rank, be they corrupted, prideful, or otherwise. Additionally, as your reputation grows, you will gradually earn the accolades and support of the common people who find their streets safer, and petty thugs less inclined to hold them at knife point over a few coins. At the same time, organizations and individuals accustomed to using their coffers to help guide a settlement's definition of ""criminal"" (such as a merchant house, corrupt council member, and the like) will gradually grow to resent and perhaps lash out at your burgeoning reputation.n</p>n<h3><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Variant_Feature:_Crime_Doesn.27t_Pay"">Variant Feature:Crime Doesn't Pay</span></h3>n<p>Pulling from your prior experiences as a soldier, mercenary, or even an extensive time living the life of a vigilante, you have the skills needed to wage a kind of psychological battle against the criminal elements of society. When interrogating someone to glean information about the location, motive, or operations of their superiors, they will easily buckle under questioning and often times readily give up sensitive knowledge without the need to press further. Any promises you may make concerning their fate in exchange for information you are not obligated to keep, short of killing them.You can coordinate this information with any authority in a city you're on amiable terms with, be it the guard or militia, your own old military unit, or even a sympathetic temple's leadership, provided that temple maintains soldiers of their own.n</p><p>In addition, replace the Deception proficiency in the skills list above with Stealth, and substitute the hunter's traps and bounty trinkets with a magnifying glass and a set of manacles.n</p>n"",r"|Gather Rumors, Sense Motive, Track, Use Rope|

The placesndiscussed here are all sufficiently distant from thenNorth and the Sword Coast to justify the use of thisnbackground.n</p><p><b>Evermeet.</b> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerun. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logicaln(though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.nMost of those who emigrate from Evermeet are eithernexiles, forced out for committing some infraction ofnelven law, or emissaries who come to Faerun for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.n</p><p><b>Halruaa.</b> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerun who know about it. Many folk have heardnof the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a fewnknow of the tales that even the least of their people cannwork magic.nHalruaans usually make their journeys into Faerunnfor personal reasons, since their government has a strictnstance against unauthorized involvement with othernnations and organizations. You might have been exilednfor breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws,nor you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of thengods of magic.n</p><p><b>Kara-Tur.</b> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerun, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur,nthe people of Faerun likely refer to you as Shou, even ifnthat isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanketnterm they use for everyone who shares your origin.nThe folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerun asndiplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperousnmerchant cartels. You might have come here as part ofnsome such delegation, then decided to stay when thenmission was over.n</p><p><b>Mulhorand.</b> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort ofnculture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerun. Recentnevents in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerun.nThose who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a differentnlife do so for many reasons.

One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).
