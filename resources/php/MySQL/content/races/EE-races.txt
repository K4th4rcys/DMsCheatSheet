<h1>Aarakocra</h1>
<p><strong>AARAKOCRA TRAITS</strong></p>
<p>As an aarakocra, you have certain traits in common with your people. Being able to fly at high speed starting at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others. As a result, playing an aarakocra requires special consideration by your DM.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>Aarakocra reach maturity by age 3. Compared to humans, aarakocra don&rsquo;t usually live longer than 30 years.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alignment. </em></strong>Most aarakocra are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Tribal leaders and warriors might be lawful, while explorers and adventurers might tend toward chaotic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size. </em></strong>Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall. They have thin, lightweight bodies that weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed. </em></strong>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flight. </em></strong>You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Talons. </em></strong>You are proficient with your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Language. </em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common, Aarakocra, and Auran.</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra, sometimes called birdfolk, evoke fear and wonder. Many aarakocra aren&rsquo;t even native to the Material Plane. They hail from a world beyond&mdash;from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air. They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds in a world both strange and alien.</p>
<p><strong>BEAK AND FEATHER</strong></p>
<p>From below, aarakocra look much like large birds. Only when they descend to roost on a branch or walk across the ground does their humanoid appearance reveal itself. Standing upright, aarakocra might reach 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons.</p>
<p>Feathers cover their bodies. Their plumage typically denotes membership in a tribe. Males are brightly colored, with feathers of red, orange, or yellow. Females have more subdued colors, usually brown or gray. Their heads complete the avian appearance, being something like a parrot or eagle with distinct tribal variations.</p>
<p><strong>SKY WARDENS</strong></p>
<p>Nowhere are the aarakocra more comfortable than in the sky. They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the thermals hold them aloft. In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.</p>
<p>Once airborne, an aarakocra leaves the sky with reluctance. On their native plane, they can fly for days or months, landing only to lay their eggs and feed their young before launching themselves back into the air. Those that make it to a world in the Material</p>
<p>Plane find it a strange place. They sometimes forget or ignore vertical distances, and they have nothing but pity for those earthbound people forced to live and toil on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>AVIAN MANNERISMS</strong></p>
<p>The resemblance of aarakocra to birds isn&rsquo;t limited to physical features. Aarakocra display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds. They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently tending their feathers, cleaning and scratching away any tiny passengers they might have picked up. When they deign to descend from the sky, they often do so near pools where they can catch fish and bathe themselves.</p>
<p>Many aarakocra punctuate their speech with chirps, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning, much as a human might through facial expressions and gestures. An aarakocra might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an aarakocra&rsquo;s threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.The idea of ownership baffles most aarakocra. After all, who owns the sky? Even when explained to them, they initially find the notion of ownership mystifying. As a result, aarakocra who have little interaction with other people might be a nuisance as they drop from the sky to snatch livestock or plunder harvests for fruits and grains. Shiny, glittering objects catch their eyes.They find it hard not to pluck the treasure and bring it back to their settlement to beautify it. An aarakocra who spends years among other races can learn to inhibit these impulses.</p>
<p>Confinement terrifies the aarakocra. To be grounded, trapped underground, or imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few aarakocra can withstand. Even when perched on a high branch or at rest in their mountaintop homes, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.</p>
<p><strong>HOMELANDS</strong></p>
<p>Most aarakocra live on the Elemental Plane of Air. Aarakocra can be drawn into the Material Plane, sometimes to pursue enemies or thwart their foes&rsquo; designs there. Accident might also send a nest of aarakocra tumbling into a world on that plane. A few find their way to such a world through portals on their own plane and establish nests in high mountains or in the canopies of old forests.</p>
<p>Once tribes of aarakocra settle in an area, they share a hunting territory that extends across an area up to 100 miles on a side, with each tribe hunting in the lands nearest to their colony, ranging farther should game become scarce.</p>
<p>A typical colony consists of one large, open -roofed nest made of woven vines. The eldest acts as leader with the support of a shaman.</p>
<p><strong>GREAT PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>Aarakocra enjoy peace and solitude. Most of them have little interest in dealing with other peoples and less interest in spending time on the ground. For this reason, it takes an exceptional circumstance for an aarakocra to leave his or her tribe and undertake the adventurer&rsquo;s life. Neither treasure nor glory is enough to lure them from their tribes; a dire threat to their people, a mission of vengeance, or a catastrophe typically lies at the heart of the aarakocra adventurer&rsquo;s chosen path.</p>
<p>Two other circumstances might call an aarakocra to adventure. First, aarakocra have historical ties to the Wind Dukes of Aqaa. Exceptional individuals honor that connection and might seek out the missing pieces of the <em>Rod of Seven Parts </em>, the remains of an artifact fashioned by the Wind Dukes long ago to defeat the Queen of Chaos&rsquo;s monstrous champion, Miska the Wolf -Spider. When plunged into Miska&rsquo;s body, the chaos in his blood sundered the rod and scattered its pieces across the multiverse. Recovering the pieces means gaining honor and esteem in the eyes of the vaati who forged it and could possibly restore a powerful weapon for defense against the agents of elemental evil.</p>
<p>Second, aarakocra are sworn foes of elemental earth, in particular the gargoyles that serve Ogr &eacute;moch, the Prince of Earth. The Aarakocra word for gargoyle</p>
<p>is loosely translated as &ldquo;flying rock,&rdquo; and battles between aarakocra and gargoyles have raged across the Elemental Planes of Earth and Air, occasionally spilling into a world on the Material Plane. Aarakocra on that plane might leave their colonies to lend aid to other humanoids committed to fighting earth cults and thwarting their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>AARAKOCRA BACKGROUNDS</strong></p>
<p>Backgrounds that are most appropriate for aarakocra include the outlander, the hermit, and the sage.</p>
<p>The small colonies of aarakocra are insular and remote, and few aarakocra live away from their roosts. In the Star Mounts of the High Forest in the Forgotten Realms, no more than a few dozen aarakocra live away from the nests of their families. Those that do are usually rangers or fighters, constantly patrolling for outside threats.</p>",

<h1>Deep&nbsp;Gnome</h1>
<p><em>Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind- hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins.</em></p>
<p><strong>DEEP GNOME TRAITS</strong></p>
<p>When you create a gnome character, you may choose the deep gnome as an alternative to the subraces in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook </em>. For your convenience, the traits of the <a href="http://class.com/gnome">gnome </a>and the deep gnome are combined here.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>Deep gnomes are short-lived for gnomes. They mature at the same rate humans do and are considered full-grown adults by 25. They live 200 to 250 years, although hard toil and the dangers of the Underdark often claim them before their time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alignment. </em></strong>Svirfneblin believe that survival depends on avoiding entanglements with other creatures and not making enemies, so they favor neutral alignments. They rarely wish others ill, and they are unlikely to take risks on behalf of others.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size. </em></strong>A typical svirfneblin stands about 3 to 3&frac12; feet tall and weighs 80 to 120 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed. </em></strong>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<strong><em> Superior Darkvision. </em></strong>Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gnome Cunning. </em></strong>You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stone Camouflage. </em></strong>You have advantage on Dexterity (stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain.</p>
<p><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common, Gnomish, and Undercommon. The svirfneblin dialect is more guttural than surface Gnomish, and most svirfneblin know only a little bit of Common, but those who deal with outsiders (and that includes you as an adventurer) pick up enough Common to get by in other lands.</p>
<p><strong>OPTIONAL FEAT</strong></p>
<p>If your DM allows the use of feats from chapter 6 of the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>, your deep gnome character has access to the following special feat.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>SVIRFNEBLIN MAGIC</strong></em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Prerequisite: Gnome (deep gnome)</em></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast <em>nondetection</em> on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: <em>blindness/deafness</em>, <em>blur</em>, and <em>disguise self</em>. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><strong>BORN OF DEEP EARTH</strong></p>
<p>Svirfneblin seem more like creatures of stone than flesh. Their leathery skin is usually a gray, brown, or dun hue that acts as a natural camouflage with the rock around them. Their bodies are gnarled with hard muscle or fat, and they are heavier than their small stature suggests; svirfneblin often weigh 100 pounds or more but rarely stand much more than 3 feet tall.</p>
<p>Male svirfneblin are bald from early childhood, although adults can grow stiff beards or mustaches.</p>
<p>Females have full heads of hair, and they usually tie their hair back in braids or cut it short to keep it from getting in their way as they work.</p>
<p>Svirfneblin are well adapted for their subterranean existence. They have excellent darkvision, and many of them have magical talents that rival the innate spellcasting of the drow and duergar. They are surprisingly strong for their size, enduring toil and danger that would overwhelm most other people</p>
<p><strong>MASTER MINERS</strong></p>
<p>Despite their guarded natures, svirfneblin aren&rsquo;t joyless. They admire skillful work and delicate craftsmanship, just like any other gnome. Svirfneblin love gemstones of all kinds, and they boldly seek out precious stones in the deepest and darkest tunnels. They are also expert gemcutters and miners, and they prize rubies above all other gemstones.</p>
<p><strong>DEEP DWELLERS</strong></p>
<p>Svirfneblin are known as deep gnomes because they choose to live far below the earth&rsquo;s surface. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day. Their homes are well-hidden strongholds concealed by mazelike passages and clever illusions. Vast networks of mine tunnels ring most svirfneblin settlements, guarded by deadly traps and concealed sentries. Once a traveler passes through the outer defenses, the tunnels open up into marvelous cavern-towns carved from the surrounding rock with exquisite care. The svirfneblin are austere in their comforts compared to their surface cousins, but they take great pride in their stonework.</p>
<p>Deep gnomes do their best to remain hidden. Even if surface travelers succeed in locating a svirfneblin community, winning their trust can be even more difficult. Those rare travelers who do succeed in befriending deep gnomes find that they are loyal and courageous allies against any foe.</p>
<p><strong>SCOUTS AND SPIES</strong></p>
<p>Surface-dwelling gnomes often take up the adventurer&rsquo;s life out of sheer curiosity about the world around them, eager to see new things and meet new people. By comparison, most svirfneblin possess very little wanderlust and rarely travel far from home. They see the surface world as a bewildering place without boundaries and filled with unknown dangers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a few svirfneblin understand that it is necessary to know something about what is happening on the surface near their hidden refuges. As a result, some svirfneblin become scouts, spies, or messengers who venture abroad, doing their best to avoid attention. These travelers are notoriously close-mouthed about where they come from and what they are up to, but a few eventually learn to trust good-hearted people of the surface world.</p>
<p>A few svirfneblin become merchants who deal with other races both above and below ground. Drow, duergar, and other peoples know that svirfneblin are usually neutral in outlook and typically honest in their dealings. Serving as middlemen between races too hostile to deal with each other directly can be lucrative, and it serves an important defensive function; svirfneblin middlemen tend to know more about rumors and threats between rival merchants than anybody else.</p>",

<h1>Genasi</h1>
<p><strong>GENASI TRAITS</strong></p>
<p>Your genasi character has certain characteristics in common with all other genasi.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>

<p><strong><em>Subraces. </em></strong>Four major subraces of genasi are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>AIR GENASI</h2>
<p>As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.</p>
<p>Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unending Breath. </em></strong>You can hold your breath indefinitely while you&rsquo;re not incapacitated.</p>

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>EARTH GENASI</h2>
<p>As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren&rsquo;t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.</p>
<p>Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Earth Walk. </em></strong>You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without expending extra movement.</p>
<p><strong><em>Merge with Stone. </em></strong>You can cast the <a href="http://spell.com/pass without trace">pass without trace</a><em>&nbsp;</em>spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FIRE GENASI</h2>
<p>As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.</p>
<p>Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkvision. </em></strong>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your darkvision unusual: everything you see in darkness is in a shade of red.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fire Resistance. </em></strong>You have resistance to fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reach to the Blaze. </em></strong>You know the <a href="http://spell.com/produce flame">produce flame</a>&nbsp;cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <em>burning hands </em>spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>WATER GENASI</strong></h2>
<p>The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths&mdash;all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.</p>
<p>Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi&rsquo;s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid Resistance. </em></strong>You have resistance to acid damage.<strong><em> Amphibious. </em></strong>You can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swim. </em></strong>You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Call to the Wave. </em></strong>You know the <a href="http://spell.com/shape water">shape water</a><em>&nbsp;</em>cantrip (see chapter 2). When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <em>create or destroy water</em> spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.</p>
<p>The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, don&rsquo;t face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit&mdash;whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.</p>
<p>During these visits, a mortal might catch a genie&rsquo;s eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal&ndash;genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that&rsquo;s lain dormant for generations.</p>
<p>Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.</p>
<p><strong>HEIRS TO ELEMENTAL POWER</strong></p>
<p>Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.</p>
<p>Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).</p>
<p>Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.</p>
<p>Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.</p>
<p><strong>WILD AND CONFIDENT</strong></p>
<p>Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self-confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.</p>
<p>Too much failure can chip away at even a genasi&rsquo;s sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.</p>
<p><strong>GENASI LANDS</strong></p>
<p>As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.</p>
<p>Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends.</p>
<p>Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.</p>
<p>Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faer&ucirc;n, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland. In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.</p>
<p>The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faer&ucirc;n. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.</p>",

"full_text":"
<h1>Goliath</h1>
<p><em>At the highest mountain peaks&mdash;far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl&mdash;dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm&nbsp;</em><em>of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.</em></p>
<h2><strong>GOLIATH TRAITS</strong></h2>
<p>Goliaths share a number of traits in common with each other.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alignment. </em></strong>Goliath society, with its clear roles and tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on self-sufficiency and personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size. </em></strong>Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed. </em></strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Natural Athlete. </em></strong>You have proficiency in the <a href="http://skill.com/Athletics">Athletics</a>&nbsp;skill.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stone&rsquo;s Endurance. </em></strong>You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Powerful Build. </em></strong>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mountain Born. </em></strong>You&rsquo;re acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You&rsquo;re also naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><strong>DRIVEN COMPETITORS</strong></p>
<p>Every day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual&rsquo;s heroic effort can ensure the entire group&rsquo;s survival.</p>
<p>Goliaths thus place a premium on self- sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills. This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.</p>
<p><strong>FAIR PLAY</strong></p>
<p>For goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.</p>
<p>This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society&rsquo;s structures or rules to maintain power.</p>
<p><strong>SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST</strong></p>
<p>Among goliaths, any adult who can&rsquo;t contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can&rsquo;t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.</p>
<p>A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.</p>
<p>In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay. Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by long-term leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.</p>",
