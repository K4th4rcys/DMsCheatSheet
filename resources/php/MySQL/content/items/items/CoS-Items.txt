<div><h2>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</h2>
<p><b>Category:</b> Wondrous</p><hr />
<div>This item requires attunement by a cleric or paladin of good alignment</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven - or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.</div>
<div>The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.</div>
<div>The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6+4 charges daily at dawn.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Hold Vampires</strong>: As an Action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect on itself.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Turn Undead</strong>: If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Sunlight</strong>: As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).</div>

<div><h2>Tome of Strahd</h2><hr /><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Tome of Strahd is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact.</p><hr />

<p><i>I am The Ancient, I am The Land. My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered auoss the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears stone into sand. &hellip; All goodness slipped from my life; I found my youth and strength gone and all I had left was death. My army settled in the valley of Barovia and took power over the people in the name of a just god, but with none of a god&rsquo;s grace or justice. I called for my family, long unseated from their ancient thrones, and brought them here to settle in the castle Ravenloft. They came with a younger brother of mine, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful. I hated him for both. &hellip; From the families of the valley, one spirit shone above all others. A rare beauty, who was called &ldquo;perfection,&rdquo; &ldquo;joy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;treasure.&rdquo; Her name was Tatyana and I longed for her to be mine. I loved her with all my heart. I loved her for her youth. I loved her for her joy. But she spurned me! &ldquo;Old One&rdquo; was my name to her &ndash; &ldquo;elder&rdquo; and &ldquo;brother&rdquo; also. Her heart went to Sergei. They were betrothed. The date was set. &hellip; With words she called me &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; but when I looked into her eyes they reflected another name &ndash; &ldquo;death.&rdquo; It was the death of the aged that she saw in me. She loved her youth and enjoyed it. But I had squandered mine. The death she saw in me turned her from me. And so I came to hate death, my death. My hate is&nbsp;very strong: I would not be called &ldquo;death&rdquo; so soon. I made a pact with Vol, a pact of Blood. On the day of the wedding, I killed Sergei, my brother. My pact was sealed with his blood, his&hellip;divinity. I found Taryana weeping in the garden east of the Chapel. She fled from me. She would not let me explain, and a great anger swelled within me. She had to understand the pact I made for her! I pursued her. Finally, in despair, she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft and I watched everything I ever wanted fall from my grasp forever. It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found. Not even I know her final fate. Arrows from the castle guards pierced me to my soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. I became undead, forever. &hellip; I have studied much since then. &ldquo;Vampyr&rdquo; is my new name. I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the living that took them from me. Even the sun is against me. it is the sun and light I fear the most. But little else can harm me now. Even a stake through my heart does not kill me, though it holds me from movement. But the sword, that cursed sword that Sergei brought! I must dispose of that awful tool! I fear and hate it as much as the sun. &hellip; I have learned much, too, about this land of Barovia. Ancient are its ways, ancient beyond the knowledge of the simple folk of the valley. A ancient saints dwelt in this valley long before my coming, and three hidden fanes still give tribute to their memories. I visted the Swamp Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Mountain Fane, and claimed their power for my own. Their servants now serve me, and thus I have become the Land. &hellip; I have often hunted for Tatyana. I have even felt her within my grasp, but she escapes me! She taunts me! She taunts me! What will it take to bend her love to me? I now reside far helow Ravenloft. I live among the dead and sleep beneath the very stones of this hollow castle of despair. I shall seal shut the walls of the stairs that none may disturb me.</i></p>
