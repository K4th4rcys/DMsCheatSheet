<p><em><span class="fontstyle2">Master rune, rare (requires attunement)&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle0">This triangular fire opal measures about three inches on each side and is half an inch thick. The </span><span class="fontstyle2">ild </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune&mdash;the rune of fire&mdash;shimmers within its core. Grasping this object causes a split second of searing, fiery pain to pass through you. That pain quickly fades, giving way to a warming glow.</span></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Ignite (Simple Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you scribe the </span><span class="fontstyle2">ild </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune using ash onto a flammable object. That object immediately bursts into flame. While it burns, the fire extends 1 foot out from the rune you scribed.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Fire Tamer (Simple Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you touch an open flame and scribe the </span><span class="fontstyle2">ild </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune within it with a hand motion. This causes the flame to immediately extinguish. For a large blaze, the fire </span><span class="fontstyle0">is extinguished in a 10-foot radius around you. You can extend this distance by expending a spell slot when using the </span><span class="fontstyle2">ild </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune in this manner. The radius extends by 20 feet per level of the expended spell slot.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Fire&rsquo;s Friend (Simple Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">While you are attuned to this rune, you have resistance to cold damage.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Combustion (Complex Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you scribe this rune using ash onto a creature within your reach as you expend a spell slot. The creature automatically takes 1d10 fire damage plus 1d10 fire damage per level of the expended spell slot.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Flame Brand (Complex Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">Over the course of a short rest, you inscribe this rune using ash onto a melee or ranged weapon, or onto up to 20 pieces of ammunition. The weapon or ammunition gains a ghostly aura of yellow flame and deals fire damage instead of piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. In addition, you can expend a spell slot while using this property to grant the weapon or ammunition a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot&rsquo;s level divided by three. These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Flame Stoker (Complex Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">While you are attuned to this rune, your fire attacks are deadlier. Whenever you roll fire damage from an attack or a spell you cast, you can reroll that damage and use the higher result.</span> </p>",

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle0">This spherical chunk of granite is about the size of a human fist. The </span><span class="fontstyle1">stein </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune&mdash;the rune of stone&mdash;appears on the orb as crystalline veins that play across its surface. When first grasped, the stone feels impossibly heavy, as if even a titan could not lift it. That feeling passes after a moment, allowing you to carry the stone with ease.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Indomitable Stand (Simple Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you scribe the </span><span class="fontstyle1">stein </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune onto the ground at your feet.

The weapon gains a ghostly brown aura, and bludgeoning damage dealt by the weapon ignores resistance and immunity. If you roll the maximum on the weapon&rsquo;s damage die or dice, the target of your attack is knocked prone if it is a creature. In addition, you can expend a spell slot to grant the weapon a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot&rsquo;s level divided by three. These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Earthen Step (Complex Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast </span><span class="fontstyle1">meld into stone </span><span class="fontstyle0">as a bonus action. You regain this ability after a short or long rest.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle3"><strong>Overwhelming Bolt (Complex Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you scribe this rune using dirt or crushed rock onto a creature within your reach as you expend a spell slot. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 12 + the level of the expended spell slot). On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 bludgeoning damage per level of the expended spell slot and is knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.</span> </p>",

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle0">This five-foot-long blue pennant is crafted from silk and whips about as if buffeted by a strong breeze. The </span><span class="fontstyle2">vind </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune&mdash;the rune of wind&mdash;flickers across its surface like a shimmering cloud. Grasping the pennant causes you to feel a powerful gust of wind wash over you, tearing at your clothes and gear. Anyone watching you sees nothing out of </span><span class="fontstyle0">the ordinary, and the sensation passes after a moment.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle4"><strong>Comforting Wind (Simple Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">While you are attuned to this rune, you cannot suffocate or drown, and you gain advantage on saving throws against poisonous gases, inhaled poisons, and similar effects.

<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle4"><strong>Howling Brand (Complex Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">Over the course of a short rest, you inscribe this rune in the air above one ranged weapon. The weapon gains a ghostly blue aura and has its normal and maximum range doubled. The weapon&rsquo;s attacks do not suffer disadvantage due to range. In addition, you can expend a spell slot while using this property to grant the weapon a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot&rsquo;s level divided by three. These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again.
<br />
</span><span class="fontstyle4"><strong>Shrieking Bolt (Complex Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you scribe this rune in the air between you and a creature you can see while you expend a spell slot. The creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC 12 + the spell slot&rsquo;s level). On a failure, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 bludgeoning damage per level of the expended spell slot, and is pushed in a straight line directly away from you for 10 feet per level of the expended spell slot. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed away from you.
<br />

</span></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle0">This long, slender shard of ice is roughly the size of a dagger. The </span><span class="fontstyle1">kalt </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune&mdash;the rune of ice&mdash;glows within the shard. When first grasped, the shard emits a painful cold that leaves your hand and arm numb. That feeling passes after a moment, allowing the shard to be handled normally.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>Frigid Touch (Simple Property).</strong> </span><span class="fontstyle0">As an action, you scribe the </span><span class="fontstyle1">kalt </span><span class="fontstyle0">rune on the surface of any volume of water.
