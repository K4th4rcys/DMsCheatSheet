<div class="monster-detail">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="monster-detail"><b><i>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).</i></b> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage, plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, Strahd can grapple it (escape DC 18) instead of dealing the bludgeoning damage.</div>
<div class="monster-detail">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="monster-detail"><b><i>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).</i></b> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Strahd, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Strahd regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Strahd's control.</div>
<div class="monster-detail">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="monster-detail"><b><i>Charm</i></b> Strahd targets one humanoid he can see within 30 ft. of him. If the target can see Strahd, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed. The charmed target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it.<br />Each time Strahd or his companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</div>
<div class="monster-detail">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="monster-detail"><b><i>Children of the Night (1/day).</i></b> Strahd magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or swarms rats, provided that the sun isn't up.
