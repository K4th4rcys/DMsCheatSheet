<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aarakocra range the Howling Gyre</strong>, an endless storm</p>
<p>of mighty winds and lashing rains that surrounds the</p>
<p>tranquil realm of Aaqa in the Elemental Plane of Air.</p>
<p>Making aerial patrols, these birdlike humanoids guard</p>
<p>the windy borders of their home against invaders from</p>
<p>the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as gargoyles, their</p>
<p>sworn enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enemies of Elemental Evil</strong>. In service to the Wind</p>
<p>Dukes of Aaqa, aarakocra scout the planes in search</p>
<p>of temples of Elemental Evil. They spy on malign</p>
<p>elemental creatures and then either take the fi ght to</p>
<p>those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On the Material Plane</strong>, aarakocra create aeries atop</p>
<p>the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals</p>
<p>to the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights,</p>
<p>aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions,</p>
<p>as well as for nascent threats to their home plane.</p>
<p>Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind-<br />unburdened and ever moving- yet they watch over a</p>
<p>region for years if that's what it takes to guard against</p>
<p>the incursions of Elemental Evil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aarakocra have no concept</strong> of political borders or</p>
<p>property ownership, and the value of gems, gold, and</p>
<p>other precious materials means little to aarakocra. In</p>
<p>their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and</p>
<p>then cast what is left on the wind for others to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Search for the Seven Shards</strong>. The Wind Dukes</p>
<p>of Aaqa come from a race of elemental beings called</p>
<p>the vaati, which once ruled many worlds. A creature</p>
<p>known as the Queen of Chaos arose and initiated an</p>
<p>interplana r war against vaati rule. To combat the threat,</p>
<p>seven vaati heroes combined their powers to create</p>
<p>the mighty Rod of Law. In a battle against the queen's</p>
<p>greatest general, Mishka the Wolf Spider, a vaati killed</p>
<p>Mishka by thrusting the rod into him like a spear. The</p>
<p>rod shattered into seven shards that scattered across</p>
<p>the multiverse. Aaracokra seek signs of the pieces'</p>
<p>locations in order to rebuild what is now know as the</p>
<p>Rod of Seven Parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMONING AIR ELEMENTALS</strong></p>
<p>Five aarakocra within 30 feet of each other can magically</p>
<p>summon an air elemental. Each of the five must use its</p>
<p>action and movement on three consecutive turn s to perform</p>
<p>an aerial dance and must maintain concentration while</p>
<p>doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have</p>
<p>finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears</p>
<p>in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is fri endly</p>
<p>toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains</p>
<p>for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of</p>
<p>its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action . A summoner</p>
<p>can't perform the dance again until it finishe s a short rest.</p>
<p>When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any</p>
<p>aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it.</p>

<p><strong>Detect Life</strong>. The banshee can magically sense the presence</p>
<p>of living creatures up to 5 miles away. She knows the general</p>
<p>direction they're in but not their exact locations.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>. The banshee can move through 0ther</p>
<p>creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes</p>
<p>5 (1d10) force damage if she ends he~ turn inside an object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corrupting Touch</strong>. Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one</p>
<p>target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong>Horrifying Visage</strong>. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of</p>
<p>the banshee that can see her must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom</p>
<p>saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target</p>
<p>can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,</p>
<p>with disadvantage if the banshee is within line of sight, ending</p>
<p>the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is</p>
<p>successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the</p>
<p>banshee's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Wail</strong> (1fDay). The banshee releases a mournful wail, provided</p>
<p>that she isn't in sunlight. This wail has no effect on constructs</p>
<p>and undead. Al l other creatures within 30 feet of her that can</p>
<p>hear her must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On</p>
<p>a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a</p>
<p>creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When night falls</strong>, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries</p>
<p>of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a</p>
<p>spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Banshees appears</strong> as luminous, wispy forms that</p>
<p>vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee's face is</p>
<p>wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy</p>
<p>rags that flutter and stream around it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Divine Wrath</strong>. Banshees are the undead remnants of</p>
<p>elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their</p>
<p>gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their</p>
<p>beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves afflicted by</p>
<p>the banshee's curse experience no gladness, feeling</p>
<p>only distress in the presence of the Jiving. As the curse</p>
<p>takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death</p>
<p>completes their transformation into undead monsters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sorrow Bound</strong>. A banshee becomes forever bound to</p>
<p>the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five</p>
<p>miles from there. It is forced to relive every momerit of</p>
<p>its life ~ith perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept</p>
<p>responsibility for. its doom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beauty Hoarders</strong>. The vanity that inspired the</p>
<p>banshee's cursed creatipn persists in undeath. These</p>
<p>creatures covet beautiful objects: fine je~elry, paintings,</p>
<p>statues, and other objects of art. At the same time, a</p>
<p>banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can't bear to</p>
<p>see the horror_ of its own existence. A single glimpse of </p>
<p>itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Undead Nature</strong>. A banshee doesn't require air, food,</p>
<p>drink, or sleep.</p>",

<p>see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature</p>
<p>instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the</p>
<p>chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack,</p>
<p>the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A spectator</strong> is a lesser beholder that is summoned</p>
<p>from another plane of existence by a magical ritual, the</p>
<p>components of which include four beholder eyestalks</p>
<p>that are consumed by the ritual's magic. Appropriately,</p>
<p>a spectator has four eyes talks, two on each side of the</p>
<p>wide eye at the center of its four-foot diameter body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magical Guardians</strong>. A summoned spectator guards</p>
<p>a location or a treasure of its summoner's choice</p>
<p>for 101 years, allowing no creature but its</p>
<p>summoner to enter the area or access the item,</p>
<p>unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If</p>
<p>the item is stolen or destroyed before the years</p>
<p>have all passed, a summoned spectator vanishes.</p>
<p>It otherwise never abandons its post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Glimmers of Madness</strong>. Though it can speak, a</p>
<p>spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy. It</p>
<p>is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and</p>
<p>its summoner. However, even a brief conversation with</p>
<p>a spectator is enough to reveal quirks in its personality</p>
<p>brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent</p>
<p>imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or</p>
<p>try to adopt the voice of its summoner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Like any beholder</strong>, a spectator views itself as the</p>
<p>epitome of its kind, and it has an intense hatred of other</p>
<p>spectators. If two spectators encounter one another,</p>
<p>they almost always fight to the death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Freed from Service</strong>. When a spectator has fulfilled</p>
<p>its service, it is free to do as it pleases. Many take</p>
<p>up residence in the places they previously guarded,</p>
<p>especially if their summoners have died. With the</p>
<p>spectator's loss of purpose, the flickers of madness it</p>
<p>dis~layed during its servitude flourish.</p>",

<p>they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and</p>
<p>treasure a re assured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goblinoids</strong>. Bugbears are often found in the company</p>
<p>of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears</p>
<p>us ually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully</p>
<p>hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return</p>
<p>for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when</p>

<p>its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.</p>

<p>5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a</p>
<p>melee attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Life as a bullywug</strong> is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-<br />headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly</p>
<p>moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp</p>
<p>caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs</p>
<p>overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when</p>
<p>they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for</p>
<p>easier prey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bullywugs</strong> have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin</p>
<p>that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown,</p>
<p>allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They</p>
<p>wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can</p>
<p>deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.</p>
<p>Foul Aristocracy. Bullywugs consider themselves</p>
<p>the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow</p>
<p>an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and</p>
<p>each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their</p>
<p>leader- a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce</p>
<p>themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows</p>
<p>of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors,</p>
<p>and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A bullywug has two ways to advance</strong> among its kind.</p>
<p>It can either murder its rivals, though it must take</p>
<p>pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find</p>
<p>a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a</p>
<p>token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders</p>
<p>its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so</p>
<p>it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against</p>
<p>caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing</p>
<p>precious baubles to impress their lords and win their</p>
<p>good graces. Invariably, such fine goods.are reduced</p>
<p>to filthy tatters throug.h abuse and neglect. Once a gift</p>
<p>loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that</p>
<p>its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unruly Diplomacy</strong>. Bullywugs love nothing more than</p>
<p>lording over those who trespass on their territories.</p>
<p>Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than</p>
<p>simply slaying them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Captives</strong> are dragged before the king or queen-a</p>
<p>bullywug of unusually large size- and forced to beg</p>
<p>for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the</p>
<p>bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before</p>
<p>it tries to impress its "guests" with the majesty of its</p>
<p>treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority</p>
<p>complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings</p>
<p>and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect</p>
<p>of outsiders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amphibian Allies</strong>. Bullywugs speak a language</p>
<p>that allows them to communicate over large areas by</p>
<p>croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events</p>
<p>in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude</p>
<p>communication system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Simple concepts in the language</strong> are understandable</p>
<p>to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to</p>
<p>form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train</p>
<p>as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are</p>
<p>sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability</p>
<p>to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug</p>
<p>hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to</p>
<p>their villages.</p></div>",

<p><strong>Fiendish Charm</strong>. One humanoid the cambion can see within</p>
<p>30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or</p>
<p>be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the</p>
<p>cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm</p>
<p>from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal</p>
<p>command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving</p>
<p>throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's</p>
<p>saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the</p>
<p>creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the</p>
<p>next 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A cambion is the offspring</strong> of a fiend (usually a succubus</p>
<p>or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human).</p>
<p>Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their</p>
<p>horns, leathery wings, and sinewy tails are hallmarks of</p>
<p>their otherworldly parentage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Born to Be Bad</strong>. Cambions grow into ruthless adults</p>
<p>whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the</p>
<p>most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion</p>
<p>identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals. It</p>
<p>might orchestrate uprisings in towns and cities, gathering</p>
<p>gangs of humanoids and lesser devils to serve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pawns of the Mighty</strong>. A cambion forced to serve its</p>
<p>fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but</p>
<p>also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a</p>
<p>place of prominence. Cambions raised in the Nine Hells</p>
<p>serve as soldiers, envoys, and personal attendants to</p>
<p>greater devils. In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as</p>
<p>much authority as it can muster through sheer strength</p>
<p>and force of will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spawn ofGraz'zt</strong>. The demon lord Graz'zt is fond of</p>
<p>procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with</p>
<p>fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him</p>
<p>sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are</p>
<p>characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, six-<br />fingered hands, and unearthly beauty.</p></div>",

<p><strong>Keen Smell</strong>. The carrion crawler has advantage on Wisdom</p>
<p>(Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p>
<p>Spider Climb. The carrion crawle r can climb difficult surfaces,</p>
<p>including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an</p>
<p>ability check.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The carrion crawler makes two attacks: one with</p>
<p>its tentacles and one with its bite.</p>
<p><strong>Tentacles</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10ft., one</p>
<p>creature. Hit: 4 (1 d4 + 2) poison damage, and the target must</p>
<p>succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned</p>
<p>for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the ta rget is paralyzed.</p>
<p>The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its</p>
<p>turns, ending the poison on itself on a success.</p>
<p><strong>Bite</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) pierci ng damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Carrion crawlers scour putrid flesh</strong> from carcasses and</p>
<p>gobble the slimy bQnes that remain. They aggressively</p>
<p>attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or</p>
<p>disturbs their feasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Carrion Eaters</strong>. A carrion crawler follows the</p>
<p>scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete</p>
<p>with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus</p>
<p>hunker down in territories where death is plentiful</p>
<p>and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves,</p>
<p>sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their</p>
<p>favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to</p>
<p>battlefields and cemeteries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A carrion crawler roams on the hunt</strong>, its tentacles</p>
<p>probing the a ir for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels</p>
<p>or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as</p>
<p>they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact</p>
<p>with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants</p>
<p>of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals</p>
<p>that don't think to look up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patient Predators</strong>. Whether in subterranean</p>
<p>darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a</p>
<p>potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light</p>
<p>source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the</p>
<p>scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers</p>
<p>can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind</p>
<p>corners for prey to come to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When facing potential prey or intruders</strong>, a carrion</p>
<p>crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes</p>
<p>rigiq wit~ paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with</p>
<p>its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated</p>
<p>passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster</p>
<p>then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its</p>
<p>meal to rip&nbsp;</p>",

<p>target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning or slash ing damage</p>
<p>(claw's choice).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Crawling claws</strong> are the severed hands of murderers</p>
<p>animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing.</p>
<p>Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws</p>
<p>as extra hands in their labors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magical Origins</strong>. Through dark necromantic rituals,</p>
<p>the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand,</p>
<p>haunting and animating it. If a dead murderer's spirit</p>
<p>a lready manifests as another undead creature, if the</p>
<p>murderer is raised from death, or if the spirit has long</p>
<p>passed on to another plane, the ritual fails.</p>
<p>The ritual invoked to create a crawling claw works</p>
<p>best with a hand recently severed from a murderer. To</p>
<p>this end, ritualists and their servants frequent public</p>
<p>executions to gain possession of suitable hands, or</p>
<p>make bargains with assassins and torturers.</p>
<p>Creator's Control. A crawling claw can't be turned,</p>
<p>nor can it be controlled by spells that control undead.</p>
<p>These foul monsters are entirely bound to the will of</p>
<p>their creator, which can concentrate on a claw in sight</p>
<p>to mentally command its every action. If the crawling</p>
<p>claw's creator doesn't command it, the claw follows its</p>
<p>last command to the best of its ability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Commands given to a crawling claw</strong> must be simple. A</p>
<p>claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular</p>
<p>person, because its limited senses and intelligence</p>
<p>prevent it from tracking and picking out specific</p>
<p>individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures</p>
<p>in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily</p>
<p>feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling</p>
<p>from room to room on a blind killing spree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Malign InteiHgence</strong>. A crawling claw possesses little</p>
<p>of the intellect and memories of the individual of which</p>
<p>it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed</p>
<p>that drove that person to murder lingers on, however,</p>
<p>amplified by the claw's torturous fragmented state.</p>
<p>Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and</p>
<p>recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Living Claws</strong>. If a crawling claw is animated from</p>
<p>the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual</p>
<p>binds the claw to the murderer's soul. The disembodied</p>
<p>hand can then return to its former limb, its undead flesh</p>
<p>knitting to the living arm from which it was severed.</p>
<p>Made whole again, the murderer acts as though</p>
<p>the hand had never been severed and the ritual had</p>
<p>never taken place. When the crawling claw separates</p>
<p>again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the</p>
<p>crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the</p>
<p>murderer. However, killing the murderer has no effect</p>
<p>on the crawling claw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Undead Nature</strong>. A crawling claw doesn't require air,</p>
<p>food, drink, or sleep.</p></div>",

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyclopes</strong> are one-eyed giants that eke out a meager</p>
<p>existence in wild lands. Isolationists by nature, they</p>
<p>avoid contact with other races and try to drive away</p>
<p>strangers in their territory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nonreligious</strong>. Legends claim that the cyclopes are</p>
<p>the spawn of one of the gods of the giants, but these</p>
<p>creatures pay little heed to any deities. They see little</p>
<p>benefit in prayer and dislike ritual, which they perceive</p>
<p>as complex and foreign. However, a cyclops that gains</p>
<p>direct benefit from some site of divine power, or which is</p>
<p>threatened by a supernatural force or creature, will pay</p>
<p>homage as long as the benefit or threat remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unsophisticated</strong>. Though they are reasonably</p>
<p>intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive lives, keeping</p>
<p>herds of animals for food. They prefer to dwell alone</p>
<p>or in small family groups, )airing in caves, ruins, or</p>
<p>rough structures of dry stone construction they build</p>
<p>themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at</p>
<p>night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to</p>
<p>let it serve double duty as a barn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A cyclops lairs</strong> within a day's journey of other</p>
<p>cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek</p>
<p>mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone,</p>
<p>but will use metal when they can find it. Although</p>
<p>cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write</p>
<p>nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for</p>
<p>their interactions with each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyclopes don't use money</strong> for trade, but they value</p>
<p>gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as</p>
<p>jewelry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with</p>
<p>feathers and silver coins, but also with pewter goblets,</p>
<p>cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unwise</strong>. Cyclopes aren't great thinkers or strategists.</p>
<p>Slow to learn and bound to their traditional ways, they</p>
<p>find innovation difficult. Although they are a terrifying</p>
<p>threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can</p>
<p>often be tricked by clever foes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cyclopes can be cowed</strong> and awed by obvious displays</p>
<p>of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can</p>
<p>be deceived into mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other</p>
<p>caster for a powerful divine figure. However, their sense</p>
<p>of pride causes them to react with vengeful, bloodthirsty</p>
<p>violence once they learn that the individual they</p>
<p>assumed was a "god" is a mere mortal.</p></div>",

<p>it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have</p>
<p>advantage on saving throws against features th at turn undead.</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting</strong>. The death knight is a 19th-level spell caster. Its</p>
<p>spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit</p>
<p>with spell attacks). It has the followin g paladin spells prepared:</p>
<p><strong>1st level</strong> (4 slots): command, compelled duel, searing smite</p>
<p><strong>2nd level</strong> (3 slots): hold per-son, magic weapon</p>
<p><strong>3rd level</strong> (3 slots): dispel magic, elemental weapon</p>
<p><strong>4th level</strong> (3 slots): banishment, staggering smite</p>
<p><strong>5th level</strong> (2 slots): destructive wave (necrotic)</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The death knight makes three longsword attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Longsword</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft. ,</p>
<p>one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 +</p>

<p><strong>Hellfire Orb (1/Day)</strong>. The death knight hurls a magical ball</p>
<p>of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it.</p>
<p>Each creature in a 20-foot&middot;radius sphere centered on that point</p>
<p>must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads</p>
<p>around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and</p>
<p>35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much</p>

<p><strong>REACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parry</strong>. The death knight add s 6 to its AC against one melee</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> a paladin that falls from grace dies without</p>
<p>seeking atonement, dark powers can transform the</p>
<p>once-mortal knight into a hateful undead creature. A</p>
<p>death knight is a skeletal warrior clad in fearsome plate</p>
<p>armor. Beneath its helmet, one can see the knight's</p>
<p>skull with malevolent pinpoints of light burning in its</p>
<p>eye sockets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eldritch Power</strong>. The death knight retains the ability</p>
<p>to cast divine spells. However, no death knight can</p>
<p>use its magic to heal. A death knight also attracts and</p>
<p>commands lesser undead, although death knights that</p>
<p>serve powerful fiends might have fiendish followers</p>
<p>instead. Death knights often use warhorse skeletons</p>
<p>and nightmares as mounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Immortal Until Redeemed</strong>. A death knight can arise</p>
<p>anew even after it has been destroyed. Only when it</p>
<p>atones for a life of wickedness or finds redemption can it</p>
<p>finally escape its undead purgatory and truly perish.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Resistance</strong> (3/Day). If the demilich fails a saving</p>

<p><strong>Turn Immunity</strong>. The demilich is immune to effects that</p>
<p>turn undead.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Howl</strong> (Recharge 5-6). The demilich emits a bloodcurdling</p>
<p>howl. Each creature within 30 feet of the demilich that can hear</p>
<p>the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw</p>
<p>or drop to 0 hit points. On a successful save, the creature is</p>
<p>frightened until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Life Drain</strong>. The demilich targets up to three creatures that it</p>
<p>can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC</p>
<p>19 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage,</p>
<p>and the demilich regains hit points equal to the total damage</p>
<p>dealt to all targets.</p>
<p><strong>LEGENDARY ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>The demilich can take 3 legendary actions</strong>, choosing from the</p>
<p>options below. Only one legendary action option can be used</p>
<p>at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn . The</p>
<p>demilich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn .</p>
<p><strong>Flight</strong>. The demilich flies up to half its flying speed.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud of Dust</strong>. The demilich magically swirls its dusty remains.</p>
<p>Each creature within 10 feet of the demilich, incl uding arou nd</p>
<p>a corner, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw</p>
<p>or be blinded until the end of the demilich's next turn. A</p>
<p>creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this</p>
<p>effect until the end of the demilich's next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (Costs 2 Actions). Each creature with in 30 feet</p>
<p>of the demilich must make a DC 15 Constitution saving</p>
<p>throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum</p>
<p>is magically reduced by 10 (3d6). If a creature's hit point</p>
<p>maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies.</p>
<p>A creature's hit point maximum can be restored with the</p>
<p>greater restoration spell or similar magic.</p>
<p><strong>Vile Curse</strong> (Costs 3 Actions). The demilich targets one creature</p>
<p>it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a</p>
<p>DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically cursed. Until the</p>
<p>curse ends, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and</p>
<p>saving throws. The target can repeat the saving throw at the</p>
<p>end of each of its turns, ending the curse on a success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The immortality</strong> granted to a lich lasts only as long as</p>
<p>it feeds mortal souls to its phylactery. If it falters or fails</p>
<p>in that task, its bones turn to dust until only its skull</p>
<p>remains. This "demilich" contains only a fragment of</p>
<p>the lich's malevolent life force- just enough so that if it</p>
<p>is disturbed, these remains rise into the air and assume</p>
<p>a wraithlike form. The skull then emits a terrifying</p>
<p>howl that can slay the weak-hearted and leave others</p>
<p>trembling with fear. Left alone, it sinks back down and</p>
<p>returns to the empty peace of its existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Few liches</strong> seek to become demiliches, for it means an</p>
<p>end to the existence they hoped to preserve by becoming</p>
<p>undead. However, time can erode the lich's reason and</p>
<p>memory, causing it to retreat into its ancient tomb and</p>
<p>forget to feed on souls. The spells it once knew fade</p>
<p>from its mind, and it no longer channels the arcane</p>
<p>energy it wielded as a lich. However, even as a mere</p>
<p>skull it remains a deadly and vexing enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enduring Existence</strong>. Even after a lich is reduced to</p>
<p>a demilich state, its phylactery survives. As long as its</p>
<p>phylactery is intact, the demilich can't be permanently</p>
<p>destroyed. Its skull reforms after 1d10 days, restoring</p>
<p>the creature to its wretched state. If it has the presence</p>
<p>of mind to do so, a demilich can reclaim its former</p>
<p>power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing</p>
<p>so restores the demilich to lich form, reconstituting its</p>
<p>undead body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Undead Nature</strong>. A demilich doesn't require air, food,</p>
<p>drink, or sleep. So great is a demilich's will to survive</p>
<p>that it always has the maximum number of hit points for</p>
<p>its Hit Dice, instead of average hit points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A DEMILICH'S LAIR</strong></p>
<p>A demilich hides its earthly remains and treasures in a</p>
<p>labyrinthine tomb guarded by monsters and traps. At the</p>
<p>heart of this labyrinth rests the demilich's skull and the</p>
<p>dust from its other bones.</p>
<p>In its crypt, a demilich has access to lair actions</p>
<p>and additional uses for its legendary actions. Its whole</p>
<p>lair also has unique traits. A demilich in its lair has a</p>
<p>challenge rating of 20 (24,500 XP).</p>
<p><strong>LAIR ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the demilich</p>
<p>rolls a d20. On a result of 11 or higher, the demilich</p>
<p>takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. It</p>
<p>can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p><ul><li><strong>The tomb trembles violently for a moment</strong>. Each crea-<br />ture on the floor of the tomb must succeed on a DC 19</li></ul>

<p><strong>This monstrous predator</strong> takes its name from its</p>
<p>ability to displace light so that it appears to be several</p>
<p>feet away from its actual location. A dis placer beast</p>
<p>resembles a sleek great cat covered in blue-black fur.</p>
<p>However, its otherworldly origins are clear in its six</p>
<p>legs and the two tentacles sprouting from its shoulders,</p>
<p>both ending in pads tipped with spiky protrusions. A</p>
<p>dis placer beast's eyes glow with an awful' malevolence</p>
<p>that persists even in death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unseelie</strong> <strong>Origins</strong>. Displacer beasts roamed the</p>
<p>twilight lands of the Feywild for ages, until they were</p>
<p>captured and trained by the Unseelie Court. The</p>
<p>warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to</p>
<p>reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using</p>
<p>them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous</p>
<p>prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer</p>
<p>beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape</p>
<p>their masters.</p>
<p>Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the</p>
<p>displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the</p>
<p>Seelie Court. With blink dog companions at their side,</p>
<p>fey hunters drove these predators to the fringes of the</p>
<p>Feywild, where many crossed over to the Material</p>
<p>Plane. To this day, displacer beasts and blink dogs</p>
<p>attack each other on sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Love of the Kill</strong>. Dis placer beasts kill not just for</p>
<p>food but also for sport. They target prey even when</p>
<p>not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain</p>

<div><h2>Dracolich</h2>
<p><strong>DRACOLICH TEMPLATE</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Only an ancient or adult true dragon</strong> can be transformed</li></ul>
<p>into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to</p>
<p>undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures</p>
<p>that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type,</p>
<p>such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon</p>
<p>can't be transformed into a dracolich, for it has already</p>
<p>lost too much of its physical form.</p><ul><li><strong>When a dragon becomes a dracolich</strong>, it retains its</li></ul>
<p>statistics except as described below. The dragon loses</p>
<p>any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living</p>
<p>physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all</p>
<p>of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>. The dracolich's type changes from dragon</p>
<p>to undead, and it no longer requires air, food,</p>
<p>drink, or sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Resistance</strong>. The dracolich has resistance to</p>
<p>necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong>. The dracolich has immunity</p>
<p>to poison. It also retains any immunities it had prior to</p>
<p>becoming a dracolich.</p>
<p><strong>Condition Immunities</strong>. The dracolich can't be</p>
<p>charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. It also</p>
<p>doesn't suffer from exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>. The dracolich has advantage on</p>
<p>saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Even as long-lived as they are</strong>, all dragons must</p>
<p>eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with</p>
<p>many dragons, some of which allow themselves to</p>
<p>be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient</p>
<p>rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the</p>
<p>most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing</p>
<p>that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the</p>
<p>dragon gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Death</strong>. A dracolich retains its shape and</p>
<p>size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing</p>
<p>tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal</p>
<p>form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light</p>
<p>floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence</p>
<p>of its undead mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Though many dragons</strong> pursue vain goals of</p>
<p>destruction and dominance, dracoliches are more</p>
<p>nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule</p>
<p>over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that</p>
<p>crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants</p>
<p>motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from</p>
<p>the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a</p>
<p>secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe.</p>
<p>Dracolich Phylacteries. Creating a dracolich requires</p>
<p>the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or</p>
<p>cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the</p>
<p>ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it</p>
<p>instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its</p>
<p>spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions</p>
<p>like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh rots</p>
<p>away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the</p>
<p>dragon's bones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If a dracolich's</strong> physical form is ever destroyed, its</p>
<p>spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on</p>
<p>the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with</p>
<p>another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can take</p>
<p>possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If</p>
<p>the dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the</p>
<p>dracolich's spirit has nowhere to go when its undead</p>
<p>body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife.</p></div>",

<p><strong>Maul</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10ft., one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 31 (6d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a</p>

<p><strong>Bolt</strong>. Ranged Spell Attack: +15 to hit, range 600ft., one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 24 (7d6) damage of one of the following types (empyrean's</p>
<p>&middot;choice): acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, or thunder.</p>
<p><strong>LEGENDARY ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>The empyrean</strong> can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from</p>
<p>the options below. Only one legendary action option can be</p>
<p>used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.</p>
<p>The empyrean regains spent legendary actions at the start</p>
<p>of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Attack</strong>. The empyrean makes one attack.</p>
<p>Bolster. The empyrean bolsters all non hostile creatures within</p>
<p>120 feet of it until the end of its next turn. Bolstered creatures</p>
<p>can't be charmed or frightened, and they gain advantage</p>
<p>on ability checks and saving throws until the end of the</p>
<p>empyrean's next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Trembling Strike</strong> (Costs 2 Actions). The empyrean strikes the</p>
<p>ground with its maul, triggering an earth tremor. All other</p>
<p>creatures on the ground within 60 feet of the empyrean</p>
<p>must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be</p>
<p>knocked prone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Empyreans are the celestial</strong>&nbsp;children of the</p>
<p>gods of the Upper Planes. They are universally</p>
<p>beautiful, statuesque, and self-assured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Manifest Emotion</strong>. An empyrean can experience</p>
<p>deity-like fits of serenity or rage. It can affect the</p>
<p>environment a round it by its mood. When an empyrt';,an</p>
<p>is unhappy, the clouds might cry tears of salt water, the</p>
<p>wildflowers in surrounding meadows might wilt, dead</p>
<p>fish might wash ashore in lakes or rivers, or a nearby</p>
<p>forest might lose the leaves from its trees. When an</p>
<p>empyrean is jubilant, sunlight follows it everywhere,</p>
<p>small animals frolic in its footsteps, and birds fill the sky</p>
<p>with their pleasing songs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evil Empyreans</strong>. A few empyreans have turned to</p>
<p>evil after venturing to the Lower Planes and becoming</p>
<p>corrupted, or as the result of being cursed by evil gods.</p>
<p>An evil empyrean can't survive long on the Upper</p>
<p>Planes and usually retreats to the Material Plane,</p>
<p>where it can rule over a kingdom of mortals as an</p>
<p>indomitable tyrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Immortal Titans</strong>. Empyreans don't age but can be</p>
<p>slain. Because few empyreans can imagine their own</p>
<p>demise, they fight fearlessly when drawn into battle,</p>
<p>refusing to believe that the end is upon them even when</p>
<p>standing at death's door. When an empyrean dies, its</p>
<p>spirit returns to its home plane. There, one of the fallen</p>
<p>empyrean's parents resurrects the empyrean unless he</p>
<p>or she has a good reason not to.</p></div>",

<p>radius, or bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for</p>
<p>an additional15 feet. It can switch between the options as an action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>. The flameskull has advantage on saving</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rejuvenation</strong>. If the flameskull is destroyed, it regair:~s all its hit ,</p>
<p>points in 1 hour unless holy water is sprinkled on its remains or</p>
<p>dispe l magic or remove curse spell is cast on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting</strong>. The flameskull is a 5th-level spell caster. Its</p>
<p>spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to</p>
<p>hit with spell attacks). It requires no somatic or material</p>
<p>components to cast its spells. The flameskull has the following</p>
<p>wizard spells prepared:</p>
<p>Cantrip (at will): mage hand</p><ul><li>1st level (3 slots): magic missile, shield</li><li>2nd level (2 slots): blur, flaming sphere</li><li>3rd level (1 slot): fireball</li></ul>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The flameskull uses Fire Ray twice.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Ray</strong>. Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blazing green flames and mad</strong>, echoing laughter follow</p>
<p>a disembodied skull as it patrols its demesne. When</p>
<p>the undead flameskull discovers trespassers, it blasts</p>
<p>the intruders with fiery rays from its eyes and dreadful</p>
<p>spells called up from the dark recesses of its memory.</p>
<p>Dark spellcasters fashion flameskulls from the</p>
<p>remains of dead wizards. When the ritual is complete,</p>
<p>green flames erupt from the skull to complete its ghastly</p>
<p>transformation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Legacy of Life</strong>. A flameskull only dimly recalls its</p>
<p>former life. Though it might speak in its old voice and</p>
<p>recount key events from its past, it is but an echo of its</p>
<p>former self. However, its undead transformation grants</p>
<p>it full access to the magic it wielded in life, letting it</p>
<p>cast spells while ignoring the material and somatic</p>
<p>components it can no longer employ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eternally Bound</strong>. Intelligent and vigilant, a flameskull</p>
<p>serves its creator by protecting a hidden treasure hoard,</p>
<p>a secret chamber, or a specific individual. A flameskull</p>
<p>carries out the directives given to it when it was created,</p>
<p>and it interprets those commands to the letter. A</p>
<p>flameskull's master must craft its instructions with care</p>
<p>to ensure that the creature carries out its tasks properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wreathed in Flame</strong>. The fire wreathing a flameskull</p>
<p>burns continually, giving off bright light that the</p>
<p>creature controls. It uses those flames as a weapon,</p>
<p>focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its</p>
<p>eye sockets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eldritch Rejuvenation</strong>. A flameskull's shattered</p>
<p>fragments reform unless they are splashed with holy</p>
<p>water or subjected to a dispel magic or remove curse</p>
<p>spell. If it can no longer fulfill its intended purpose,</p>
<p>the re-formed flameskull is beholden to no one and</p>

<p><strong>Greatclub</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15ft., one</p>
<p>target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage .</p>
<p><strong>Evil</strong> <strong>Eye</strong>. The fomorian magically forces a creature it can see</p>
<p>within 60 feet of it to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. The</p>
<p>creature takes 27 (6d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half</p>
<p>as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong>Curse of the Evil Eye</strong> (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).</p>
<p>With a stare, the fomorian uses Evil Eye, but on a failed</p>
<p>save, the creature is also cursed with magical deformities.</p>
<p>While deformed, the creature has its speed halved and has</p>
<p>disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks</p>
<p>based on Strength or Dexterity.</p>
<p>The transformed creature can repeat the saving throw</p>
<p>whenever it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The most hideous, and wicked</strong> of all giantkind are the</p>
<p>godles's fomohans, whose deformed bodies reflect their</p>
<p>vile demeanors. Some have facial features randomly</p>
<p>distributed around their misshapen, warty heads.</p>
<p>Others have limbs of grossly different sizes and shapes,</p>
<p>or emit terrible howls each time they draw breath</p>
<p>through misshapen mouths. Their wretched appearance</p>
<p>rarely evokes sympathy, however, for the fomorians</p>
<p>brought their doom upon themselves with the evil that</p>
<p>rules their hearts and minds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fey Curse</strong>. The elves remember when the fomorians</p>
<p>were among the most handsome of races, possessed</p>
<p>of brilliant minds and unrivaled magical ability. That</p>
<p>physical perfection did not extend to their hearts,</p>
<p>however, as a lust for magic and power consumed them.</p>
<p>The fomorians sought to conquer the Feywild and</p>
<p>enslave its inhabitants, claiming those creatures' magic</p>
<p>for themselves. When the fey united to defend their</p>
<p>realm, the fomorians fought them and were subjected to</p>
<p>a terrible curse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>One by one</strong>, the giants fell as their bodies were</p>
<p>warped to reflect the evil in their hearts. Stripped of</p>
<p>their grace and magical power, the wretched horrors</p>
<p>fled from the light, delving deep beneath the world</p>
<p>to nurse their hatred. Cursing their fate, they have</p>
<p>ever after plotted vengeance against the fey that</p>
<p>wronged them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Giants of the Underdark</strong>. The fomorians dwell</p>
<p>in eerily beautiful caverns in the Underdark, rarely</p>
<p>venturing to the surface. Their lairs feature abundant</p>
<p>access to water, fish, and mushroom forests, as well as</p>
<p>to the creatures whose slave labor keeps the fomorians</p>
<p>fed. When those slaves can no longer toil, they are</p>
<p>slain and devoured. Wickedness and depravity are the</p>
<p>cornerstones of fomorian society, in which the strongest</p>
<p>and cruelest giants rule. Fomorians mark their</p>
<p>territories with the corpses of their enemies, painting</p>
<p>their cavern walls with blood or stitching together limbs</p>
<p>and body parts to make mockeries of the creatures they</p>
<p>have killed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ruined Flesh, Evil Minds</strong>. The deformities visited</p>
<p>on the fomorians prevent them from hurling rocks like</p>
<p>their giant kin, or wearing anything more than scraps</p>
<p>of cloth. However, the grotesque positioning of their</p>
<p>eyes, noses, and ears gives fomorians keen perceptive</p>
<p>abilities, making it hard to surprise or ambush them.</p>
<p>The greed and evil of the fomorians lies at the heart</p>
<p>of their degeneration and fall, and continues to plague</p>
<p>them. Fomorians make alliances with other creatures</p>
<p>when it suits them, but they are disloyal by nature and</p>
<p>betray their allies on a whim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Curse of the Evil Eye</strong>. Fomorians can pass their</p>
<p>curse onto others using a power called the evil eye- a</p>
<p>last vestige of the giants' once-remarkable spellcasting</p>
<p>ability. A creature cursed by a fomorian's evil eye is</p>
<p>magically twisted and deformed, gaining a glimpse into</p>
<p>the pain and malice that has consumed this evil race.</p></div>",

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The first gas spores</strong> are thought to have been spawned</p>
<p>from dead beholders, whose moldering corpses fed a</p>
<p>parasitic fungus with aberrant magic. Having long since</p>
<p>adapted into a unique plant creature, a gas spore grows</p>
<p>quickly and purposefully out of any corpse, creating a</p>
<p>malevolent-looking mockery of the most feared denizen</p>
<p>of the Underdark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eye Tyrant's Form</strong>. A gas spore is a spherical,</p>
<p>balloon-like fungus that resembles a beholder from a</p>
<p>distance, though its true nature becomes. increasingly</p>
<p>obvious as one approaches it. The monster possesses</p>
<p>a blind central "eye" and rhizome growths sprouting</p>
<p>from its upper surface, superficially resembling a</p>
<p>beholder's eyestalks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Death Burst</strong>. A gas spore is a hollow shell filled with a</p>
<p>lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder</p>
<p>does. Piercing the shell with even the weakest attack</p>
<p>causes the creature to burst apart, releasing a cloud</p>
<p>of deadly spores. A creature that inhales the spores</p>
<p>becomes host to them, and is often dead within a day. Its</p>
<p>corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which</p>
<p>new gas spores arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beholder Memories</strong>. A gas spore that sprouts from a</p>
<p>beholder's corpse sometimes carries within it memories</p>
<p>of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its</p>
<p>deadly spores cast those memories adrift. Any creature</p>
<p>that inhales the spores and survives inherits one or</p>
<p>more of the beholder's fragmented memories, and might</p>
<p>gain useful information about the beholder's former lair</p>
<p>and other nearby places and creatures of interest.</p></div>",

<p><strong>Animate Boulders</strong> (1/Day). The galeb duhr magically animates</p>
<p>up to two boulders it can see within 60 feet of it. A boulder has</p>
<p>statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1</p>
<p>and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed or frightened, and it lacks</p>
<p>this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as</p>
<p>the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to l minute (as if</p>
<p>concentrating on a spell).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The galeb duhr</strong> is a boulder-like creature with stumpy</p>
<p>appendages that act as arms and legs. It has the ability</p>
<p>to animate the rocks and boulders around it, and is thus</p>
<p>usually encountered in rocky terrain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Powerful magic</strong> allows a spellcaster to summon a</p>
<p>galeb duhr from the Plane of Earth. Some galeb duhr</p>
<p>also form naturally in places touched by that plane. The</p>
<p>galeb duhr is imbued with greater intelligence than most</p>
<p>elementals, allowing it to better assess threats and to</p>
<p>communicate with creatures entering its guarded area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stone Guardian</strong>. A galeb duhr doesn't age or require</p>
<p>sustenance, making it an excellent sentinel. A powerful</p>
<p>druid might charge a galeb duhr with protecting a stone</p>
<p>circle or sacred hilltop. Another galeb duhr might be</p>
<p>created to guard an underground tomb or a wizard's</p>
<p>tower. When it chooses to, the galeb duhr can make</p>
<p>itself look like an ordinary boulder, remaining perfectly</p>
<p>still for years at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A galeb duhr is permanently bound to the Material</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plane</strong>, so that when it dies, it doesn't return to the Plane</p>
<p>of Earth. It has an excellent memory and is more than</p>
<p>happy to share information regarding its environment</p>
<p>with creatures it doesn't regard as threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stone Connection</strong>. A galeb duhr can become one with</p>
<p>the earth around it, allowing it to imbue nearby rocks</p>
<p>and boulders with a semblance of life. The galeb duhr</p>
<p>uses its animated boulders to frighten away interlopers</p>
<p>and defend whatever it has been charged to protect.</p>
<p>When it needs to move close to those intruders, it</p>
<p>presses its limbs tight to its body and rolls forward at a</p>
<p>furious pace. '</p></div>",

<p>a burst of water and foam , leaving behind only equipment the</p>
<p>marid was wearing or carrying.</p>
<p><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>. The marid's innate spellcasting ability is</p>
<p>Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit witn spell attacks). It</p>
<p>can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material</p>
<p>components:</p>
<p><strong>At will</strong>: create or destroy water, detect evil and good, detect</p>
<p>magic,fog cloud, purify food and drink</p>
<p><strong>3/day each</strong>: tongues, water breathing, water walk</p>
<p><strong>1/day each</strong>: conjure elemental (water elemental only), control</p>
<p>water, gaseous form, invisibility, plane shift</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The marid makes two trident attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Trident</strong>. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5</p>
<p>ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing</p>
<p>damage, or 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage if used with two</p>
<p>hands to make a melee attack.</p>
<p><strong>Water jet</strong>. The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot lin e</p>
<p>that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC</p>
<p>16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6)</p>
<p>bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed</p>
<p>up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a</p>
<p>success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is</p>
<p>neither pushed nor knocked prone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water</strong>, the marids</p>
<p>are the most wondrous of genie-kind. Although all</p>
<p>genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees</p>
<p>itself as clearly superior to the flighty djinn, the ground-<br />hugging dao, and the fuming efreet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Large and piscine</strong>, marids are a strange sight to</p>
<p>behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests</p>
<p>and colorful pantaloons they favor. They speak in voices</p>
<p>as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves</p>
<p>breaking against a rocky cliff. In flight, their lower</p>
<p>bodies transform into columns of foamy water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Water Lords</strong>. Water is a marid's native element,</p>
<p>and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any</p>
<p>way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe</p>
<p>naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or</p>
<p>shape clouds of fog and mist from the vapor in the air.</p>
<p>It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a</p>
<p>weapon to bludgeon its foes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marid Homes</strong>. Marids are rare on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>They inhabit mighty and majestic coral fortresses</p>
<p>located in the Elemental Plane of Water. These citadels</p>
<p>float in the depths of the plane and contain opulent, air-<br />filled chambers where slaves and guests reside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A marid doesn't expect much from its slaves</strong>, simply</p>
<p>wanting to have them for the status of ownership.</p>
<p>Marids go out of their way to obtain skilled slaves, and</p>
<p>aren't above kidnapping mortal artists, entertainers, or</p>
<p>storytellers for use in their courts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Egotistical Hierarchs</strong>. All mar ids claim a title of</p>
<p>nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis,</p>
<p>and khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on</p>
<p>the part of the self-important marids.</p>
<p>Marids treat all others-including other genies- as</p>
<p>inferiors of various grades, ranging from poor cousins to</p>
<p>petty annoyances. They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and</p>
<p>despise efreet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are among the lowest of the creatures</p>
<p>that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes</p>
<p>deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders</p>
<p>on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes</p>
<p>proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to</p>
<p>imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters</p>
<p>over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of</p>
<p>dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal is a</p>
<p>creature that knows its place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Whimsical Storytellers</strong>. Marids are champion tale-<br />tellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess</p>
<p>of marids in general and of the speaker in particular.</p>
<p>Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren't</p>
<p>always malicious in their deception, but embellishments</p>
<p>suit their fancy. Marids consider it a crime for a lesser</p>
<p>being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a</p>
<p>marid is a sure way to invoke its wrath.</p></div>",

<p><strong>Tentacles</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10ft., one</p>
<p>creature. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target</p>
<p>must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be</p>
<p>poisoned for 1 minute. The poiso ned target is paralyzed, and</p>
<p>it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,</p>
<p>ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p>The target is also grappled (escape DC 15). If the target is</p>
<p>Medium or smaller, it is also restrained until this grapple ends.</p>
<p>While grappling the target, the grell has advantage on attack</p>
<p>rolls agai nst it and can't use this attack aga inst other targets.</p>
<p>When the grell moves, any Medium or sma ller target it is</p>
<p>gra ppling moves with it.</p>
<p><strong>Beak</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one creature.</p>
<p>Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A grell</strong> resembles a bulbous floating brain with a wide,</p>
<p>sharp beak. Its ten long tentacles a re made of hundreds</p>
<p>of ring-shaped muscles sheathed in tough fibrous</p>
<p>hide. Sharp barbs line the tip each tentacle and inject</p>
<p>paralytic venom. The grell can pa rti ally retract its barbs</p>
<p>into its tentacles to handle or manipulate objects it</p>
<p>doesn't want to pierce or tear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grells have no eyes</strong> and floats by means of a sort of</p>
<p>levitation. They have keen hearing, however, and their</p>
<p>skin is s ensitive to vibrations and electrical fields,</p>
<p>a llowing them to detect the presence of creatures and</p>
<p>objects in their immediate vicinity. The creature's ability</p>
<p>to manipulate electricity to sense and move also allow it</p>
<p>to absorb lightning without harm.</p>
<p>Although solitary by nature, grells sometimes gather</p>
<p>in small groups called covens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Floating Ambushers</strong>. A grell prefers to ambush</p>
<p>lone creatures or stragglers, hovering silently near the</p>
<p>ceiling of a passage or cavern until a suitable target</p>
<p>passes below, whereupon it descends quickly and wraps</p>
<p>its tentacles around its prey. It then floats away to its lair</p>
<p>with the paralyzed creature in its clutches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alien Devourers</strong>. Grell are alien predators that group</p>
<p>other creatures into three categories: edibles, inedibles,</p>
<p>and Great Eaters (those rare creatures that might prey</p>
<p>on a grell). Grells have no compunction about attacking</p>
<p>creatures they classify as edible, including humanoids.</p>
<p>They tend to avoid bigger creatures that they have little</p>
<p>hope of carrying away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A grell will sometimes</strong> allow adventurers to wage</p>
<p>war on the other monstrous inhabitants of the dungeon</p>
<p>complex it calls home, staying out of the adventurers'</p>
<p>way as they dispose of larger threats while waiting for</p>
<p>the right time to strike.</p></div>",

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The wormlike grick waits unseen</strong>, blending in with the</p>
<p>rock of the caves and caverns it haunts. Only when prey</p>
<p>comes near does it rear up, its four barbed tentacles</p>
<p>unfurling to reveal its hungry, snapping beak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Passive Predators</strong>. Gricks rarely hunt. Instead, they</p>
<p>drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures</p>
<p>regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble</p>
<p>and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices,</p>
<p>climbing up to ledges, or coiling a round stalactites</p>
<p>to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually</p>
<p>anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets</p>
<p>the nearest prey, grabbing a fallen creature with its</p>
<p>tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Roving Ambushers</strong>. Gricks remain in an area until</p>
<p>the food supply dwindles, often because sentient</p>
<p>creatures become aware of their presence and plot</p>
<p>alternate routes a round their lairs. When prey is scarce</p>
<p>in the Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt</p>
<p>in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges.</p>
<p>A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized</p>
<p>alpha around which the others congregate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spoils of Slaughter</strong>. Over time, grick lairs accumulate</p>
<p>the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert</p>
<p>guides know to look out for these telltale signs.</p>
<p>Underdark explorers sometimes seal off the routes</p>
<p>leading to and from a grick lair to starve them, then</p>
<p>claim the wealth of the foul creatures' victims.</p></div>",

<p><strong>This construct possesses</strong> intelligence, the ability</p>

<p>devotion to its maker that persists even after its</p>
<p>maker's demise. Resembling an animated suit of</p>
<p>empty plate armor, a helmed horror serves without</p>
<p>ambition or emotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magical Purpose</strong>. Though it takes more magical</p>
<p>resources to create a helmed horror than a lesser</p>
<p>suit of animated armor, the helmed horror requires</p>
<p>less direction and maintenance as it carries out its</p>
<p>appointed tasks. A helmed horror follows its orders</p>
<p>with complete loyalty, and is intelligent enough to</p>
<p>understand the difference between an order's intent and</p>
<p>its exact wording. Unlike many constructs, it seeks to</p>
<p>fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tactical Cunning</strong>. A helmed horror fights with</p>
<p>the cunning of a skilled warrior, taking to the air as</p>
<p>it attacks weaker characters and spellcasters first.</p>
<p>However, a helmed horror lacks the insight to change</p>
<p>its environment, fortify it, or otherwise take active</p>
<p>measures to improve its defensive position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constructed Nature</strong>. A helmed horror doesn't</p>

<p><strong>Echolocation</strong>. The hook horror can't use its blindsight</p>
<p>while deafened.</p>
<p><strong>Keen Hearing</strong>. The hook horror has advantage on Wisdom</p>
<p>(Perception) checks that rely on hearing.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hook</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10ft., one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A fierce predator of the Underdark</strong>, the hook horror</p>
<p>aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The</p>
<p>subterranean caverns where these creatures dwell echo</p>
<p>with the constant clacking and scraping of their hooks</p>
<p>as they wend their way up cliffs and along cavern walls.</p>
<p>The monstrous hook horror has a head resembling a</p>
<p>vulture's and the torso of an enormous beetle, with an</p>
<p>exoskeleton studded by sharp, bony protuberances. It</p>
<p>gains its name from its long, powerfully built arms and</p>
<p>legs, which end in wickedly curved hooked claws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Echoes in the Dark</strong>. Hook horrors communicate by</p>
<p>striking their hooks against their exoskeletons or the</p>
<p>stone surfaces around them. What sounds to others like</p>
<p>random clacking noise is actually a complex language</p>
<p>that only hook horrors understand, and which carries</p>
<p>for miles through the echoing Underdark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pack Predators</strong>. The omnivorous hook horrors eat</p>
<p>lichens, fungi, plants, and any creature they can catch.</p>
<p>A hook horror's hooked limbs give it excellent purchase</p>
<p>on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their</p>
<p>climbing skills to ambush prey from above. They hunt</p>
<p>in packs, working together against the largest and most</p>
<p>dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook</p>
<p>horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Clans</strong>. Hook horrors live in extended</p>
<p>family groups or clans. Each clan is ruled by the eldest</p>
<p>female, who typically places her mate in charge of</p>
<p>the clan's hunters. Hook horrors lay eggs, which are</p>
<p>clustered in a central, well-defended area of a clan's</p>
<p>home caverns.</p></div>",

<p>presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that</p>
<p>has an Intelligence of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing</p>
<p>barriers, unless the creature is protected by a mind blank spell.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The intellect devourer makes one attack with its</p>
<p>claws and uses Devour Intellect.</p>
<p><strong>Claws</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong>Devour Intellect</strong>. The intellect devourer targets one creature</p>
<p>it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must</p>
<p>succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw aga inst this</p>
<p>magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure,</p>
<p>roll3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence</p>
<p>score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it</p>
<p>regains at least one point of Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Body Thief</strong>. The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence</p>
<p>contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If</p>
<p>it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes</p>
<p>the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes</p>
<p>control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the</p>
<p>intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other</p>
<p>effects originating outsiDe its host. The intellect devourer</p>
<p>retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as</p>
<p>well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and</p>
<p>its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows</p>
<p>everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.</p>
<p><strong>If the host body</strong> drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer</p>
<p>must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the</p>
<p>body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer</p>
<p>is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by</p>
<p>means of a wish. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the</p>
<p>intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to</p>
<p>the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then</p>
<p>dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An intellect devourer</strong> resembles a walking brain</p>
<p>protected by a crusty covering and set on bestial clawed</p>
<p>legs. This foul aberration feeds on the intelligence of</p>
<p>sentient creatures, taking over a victim's body on behalf</p>
<p>of its mind ftayer masters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Illithid Creations</strong>. Mind ftayers breed intellect</p>
<p>devourers to serve as roaming hunters of the</p>
<p>Underdark, creating an intellect devourer by taking the</p>
<p>brain of a thrall and subjecting it to a horrible ritual. As</p>
<p>it sprouts legs, the brain becomes an intelligent predator</p>
<p>as twisted and evil as its masters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Puppet Masters</strong>. An intellect devourer</p>
<p>consumes a creature's mind and memories, then turns</p>
<p>the host body into a puppet under its control. An intellect</p>
<p>devourer typically uses its puppet host to lure others</p>
<p>into the domain of the mind flayers to be enthralled</p>
<p>or consumed.</p></div>",

<p>creature it has surprised.</p>
<p><strong>Mimicry</strong>. The kenku can mimic any sounds it has heard,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kenku are feathered humanoids</strong> that wander the world</p>
<p>as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly</p>
<p>imitate any sound they hear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fallen Flocks</strong>. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes,</p>
<p>and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers</p>
<p>of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs.</p>
<p>They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for</p>
<p>grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the</p>
<p>lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw</p>
<p>attention to their shameful forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Once, the kenku held the wind</strong> in their wings,</p>
<p>embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language</p>
<p>of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now</p>
<p>lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering</p>
<p>baubles of his household, and longed to speak so</p>
<p>that they could cajole and swindle others out of such</p>
<p>treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume</p>
<p>in their master's library, they disguised themselves</p>
<p>in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master</p>
<p>learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as</p>
<p>punishment, forcing them to beg forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speech in Pantomime</strong>. Kenku can mimic the sound</p>
<p>of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might</p>
<p>make the sound of coins clinking t9gether, and a</p>
<p>kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce</p>
<p>the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs,</p>
<p>bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When</p>
<p>mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and</p>
<p>phrases they have heard, not create new sentences.</p>
<p>To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of</p>
<p>imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kenku speak to one another</strong> in much the same</p>
<p>way. Because they are adept at interpreting one</p>
<p>another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make</p>
<p>to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be</p>
<p>succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes.</p>
<p>For example, a cat's meow might be the secret code for</p>
<p>"Prepare to attack!" or "Flee for your lives!"</p>
<p>Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and</p>
<p>criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge</p>
<p>documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might</p>
<p>forge evidence to implicate another creature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Wistful Wingless</strong>. All kenku pine for the ability</p>
<p>to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one</p>
<p>another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings</p>
<p>of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic</p>
<p>reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry</p>
<p>out executions by hurling their condemned from tall</p>
<p>buildings or cliffs.</p>",

<p>must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take</p>

<p>ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VARIANT: MIND FLAYER ARCANIST</strong></p>
<p>A few mind flayers supplement their psionic power with</p>
<p>arcane spells. However, they are regarded as deviants by their</p>
<p>illithid peers and usually shunned. A mind flayer arcanist has</p>
<p>a challenge rating of8 (3,900 XP) and the following trait.</p>
<p>Spellcasting. The mind flayer is a l0th-level spellcaster.</p>
<p>Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (save DC 15, +7 to hit</p>
<p>with spell attacks). The mind flayer has the following wizard</p>
<p>spells prepared:</p>
<p><strong>Cantrips</strong> (at will): blade ward, dancing lights, mage hand,</p>
<p>shocking grasp</p><ul><li>lst level (4 slots): detect magic, disguise self, shield, sleep</li><li>2nd level (3 slots): blur, invisibility, ray of enfeeblement</li><li>3rd level (3 slots): clairvoyance, lightning bolt, sending</li><li>4th level (3 slots): confusion, hallucinatory terrain</li><li>5th level (2 slots): telekinesis, wall of force</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mind fiayers</strong>, also called illithids, are the scourge of</p>
<p>sentient creatures across countless worlds. Psionic</p>
<p>tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they</p>
<p>are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for</p>
<p>their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their</p>
<p>octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when</p>
<p>sentient creatures come near.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In eons past</strong>, illithids controlled empires that spanned</p>
<p>many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped</p>
<p>whole races of humanoid slaves, including the githyanki</p>
<p>and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined</p>
<p>by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots</p>
<p>as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds</p>
<p>can conceive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Since the fall of their empires</strong>, illithid collectives on</p>
<p>the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Psionic Commanders</strong>. Mind fiayers possess psionic</p>
<p>powers that enable them to control the minds of</p>
<p>creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths,</p>
<p>and ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy</p>
<p>and use their telepathy when issuing commands to</p>
<p>their thralls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When an illithid meets strong resistance</strong>, it avoids</p>
<p>initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like</p>
<p>physical extensions of the illithid's thoughts, these</p>
<p>thralls interpose themselves between the mind</p>
<p>fiayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their</p>
<p>master can escape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hive Mind Colonies</strong>. Solitary mind fiayers are likely</p>
<p>rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony</p>
<p>of sibling mind fiayers devoted to an elder brain- a</p>
<p>massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool</p>
<p>near the center of a mind fiayer community. From its</p>
<p>pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to</p>
<p>each individual mind fiayer within 5 miles of it, for it is</p>
<p>able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hunger of the Mind.</strong> Illithids subsist on the brains</p>
<p>of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones,</p>
<p>and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An</p>
<p>illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin</p>
<p>glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.</p>
<p>An illithid experiences euphoria as it devours</p>
<p>the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories,</p>
<p>personality, and innermost fears. Mind fiayers will</p>
<p>sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it</p>
<p>as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into</p>
<p>an intellect devourer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>QUALITH</strong></p>
<p>On the rare occasion that mind flayers need to write</p>
<p>something down, they do so in Qualith. This system of</p>
<p>tactile writing (similar to braille) is read by an illithid's</p>
<p>tentacles. Qualith is written in four-line stanzas and is so</p>
<p>alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic</p>
<p>to discern its meaning. Though Qualith can be used to keep</p>
<p>records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other</p>
<p>surfaces with warnings or instructions.</p>",

<p>A spore servant is any Large or smaller creature brought</p>

<p>plant, or undead) can't be turned into a spore servant.</p>
<p>The following characteristics change or are added to a</p>
<p>creature that becomes a spore servant.</p>
<p><strong>Retained Characteristics</strong>. The servant retains its</p>
<p>Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Strength, Dexterity,</p>
<p>Constitution, vulnerabilities, resistances, and imml!nities.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Characteristics</strong>. The servant loses its original</p>
<p>saving throw and skill bonuses, special senses, and</p>
<p>special traits. It loses any action that isn't Multiattack or</p>
<p>a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing,</p>
<p>or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon</p>
<p>attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the</p>
<p>ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage</p>
<p>comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>. The servant's type is plant, and it loses any tags.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>. The servant is unaligned.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>. Reduce all the servant's speeds by 10 feet, to a</p>
<p>minimum of 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>. The servant's ability scores change as</p>
<p>follows: Int 2 (-4), Wis 6 (- 2), Cha 1 (-5).</p>
<p><strong>Senses</strong>. The servant has blindsight with a radius of</p>
<p>30 feet, and it is blind beyond this radius.</p>
<p><strong>Condition Immunities</strong>. The servant can't be blinded,</p>
<p>charmed, frightened, or paralyzed.</p>
<p><strong>Languages</strong>. The servant loses all known languages,</p>
<p>but it responds to orders given to it by myconids using</p>
<p>rapport spores. The servant gives highest priority to</p>
<p>orders received from the most powerful myconid.</p>
<p><strong>Attacks</strong>. If the servant has no other means of dealing</p>
<p>damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmed</p>
<p>strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning</p>
<p>damage equal to ld4 +the servant's Strength modifier,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Although this monstrous carnivore</strong> feeds on</p>
<p>any creature, it prefers humanoids, especially</p>
<p>elves, half-elves, and humans. When it kills a</p>
<p>humanoid, a peryton rips out its prey's heart and</p>
<p>takes it back to its nest to be devoured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The peryton is a bizarre creature</strong> that blends the</p>
<p>body and wings of a bird of prey with the head of a</p>
<p>stag. Its strangest feature is its shadow, which appears</p>
<p>humanoid rather than reflecting the creature's physical</p>
<p>form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were</p>
<p>humans transformed by a hideous curse or magical</p>
<p>experiment, but bards tell a different tale of a man</p>
<p>whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the</p>
<p>heart of her younger, more beautiful rival and consume</p>
<p>it in a ritual intended to forever win her husband's</p>
<p>heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman's villainy</p>
<p>was exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the</p>
<p>lingering magic of her foul ritual caused the carrion</p>
<p>birds that feasted on her corpse to transform into the</p>
<p>first perytons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unnatural Hunger</strong>. A peryton's reproductive cycle</p>
<p>depends on the heart of a freshly killed humanoid. The</p>
<p>organ must be consumed by a female peryton before</p>
<p>she can reproduce. When a peryton consumes a heart,</p>
<p>its shadow changes for a brief time to reflect its true</p>
<p>monstrous form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When attacking a humanoid</strong>, a peryton is single-</p>
<p>minded and relentless, fighting until it or its prey dies.</p>
<p>If a peryton is somehow driven away, it stalks lost prey</p>
<p>from afar, attacking again when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bane of the Mountains</strong>. Perytons roost atop</p>
<p>mountain ridges and lair in high caves. They prey on</p>
<p>creatures living or wandering in the vales below, and</p>
<p>travelers on lonely mountain roads learn to keep a</p>
<p>wary eye on the sky. Because normal weapons are less</p>
<p>effective against perytons, the folk of the mountains</p>
<p>know to avoid confrontations with these monsters</p>
<p>at all costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Established settlements</strong> are attractive to perytons</p>
<p>as a renewable food source. As such, village councils</p>
<p>and local nobles' often hire adventurers to eliminate</p>
<p>peryton nests. .</p>",

<p><strong>False Appearance</strong>. While the piercer remains motionless on the</p>

<p>including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an</p>
<p>ability check.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drop</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, one creature directly</p>
<p>underneath the piercer. Hit: 3 (1d6) piercing damage per 10</p>
<p>feet fallen , up to 21 (6d6). Miss: The piercer takes half the</p>
<p>normal falling damage for the distance fallen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinging to the ceilings of caverns</strong> and large</p>
<p>subterranean passages, piercers blend in perfectly with</p>
<p>natural rock, dropping in silence to impale unsuspecting</p>
<p>foes on the ground below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A piercer</strong> is the larval form of a roper, and the two</p>
<p>creatures often attack in tandem. A rock-like shell</p>
<p>encases a piercer's body, giving it the look and texture</p>
<p>of a stalactite. That shell protects a soft, slug-like upper</p>
<p>body that lets the piercer move across cavern walls</p>
<p>and ceilings to position itself for prey. With its eye and</p>
<p>mouth closed, the piercer is difficult to distinguish from</p>
<p>ordinary rock formations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patient Hunters</strong>. Piercers can see, but they can also</p>
<p>respond to noise and heat, waiting for living creatures to</p>
<p>pass beneath them, then falling to attack. A piercer that</p>
<p>misses its chance to kill must make its slow way back</p>
<p>to the ceiling. A fallen piercer excretes a foul-smelling</p>
<p>slime when attacked, making most predators think</p>
<p>twice about eating it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Piercers gather in colonies</strong> to maximize the</p>
<p>effectiveness of their attacks, dropping simultaneously</p>
<p>to increase the odds of striking prey. After a piercer</p>
<p>successfully slays a creature, the others slowly creep</p>

<p><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>. The pixie has advantage on saving throws</p>
<p>against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>. The pixie's innate spellcasting ability is</p>
<p>Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following</p>
<p>spells, requiring only its pixie dust as a component:</p>
<p><strong>At will</strong>: druidcraft</p>
<p><strong>1/day</strong> each: confusion, dancing lights, detect evil and good,</p>
<p>detect thoughts, dispel magic, entangle, fly, phantasmal force,</p>
<p>polymorph, sleep</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Superior Invisibility</strong>. The pixie magically turns invisible until</p>
<p>its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any</p>
<p>equipment the pixie wears or carries is invisible with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Standing barely a foot tall</strong>, pixies resemble</p>
<p>diminutive elves with gossamer wings like</p>
<p>those of dragonflies or butterflies, bright as the</p>
<p>clear dawn and as luminous as the full moonrise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Curious as cats and shy as deer</strong>, pixies go where</p>
<p>they please. They like to spy on other creatures</p>
<p>and can barely contain their excitement around</p>
<p>them. The urge to introduce themselves and</p>
<p>strike up a friendship is almost overwhelming;</p>
<p>only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked</p>
<p>stays its hand. Those who wander through a</p>
<p>pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet</p>
<p>hear the occasional giggle, gasp, or sigh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pixies array themselves</strong> like princes and</p>
<p>princesses of the fey, wearing flowing</p>
<p>gowns and doublets of silk that sparkle</p>
<p>like moonlight on a pond. Some dress</p>
<p>in acorns, leaves, bark, and the pelts of</p>
<p>tiny woodland beasts. They take great pride</p>
<p>in their regalia and beam with joy when they are</p>
<p>complimented on their ensembles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magical Faerie Folk</strong>. With their innate power of</p>
<p>invisibility, pixies rarely appear unless they wish to be</p>
<p>seen. In the Feywild and on the Material Plane, pixies</p>
<p>etch patterns of frost on winter ponds and rouse the</p>
<p>buds in springtime. They cause flowers to sparkle with</p>
<p>summer dew, and color the leaves with the blazing</p>
<p>hues of autumn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pixie Dust</strong>. When pixies fly visibly, a shower of</p>
<p>sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering</p>
<p>tail of a shooting star. A mere sprinkle of pixie dust is</p>
<p>said to be able to grant the power of flight, confuse a</p>
<p>creature hopelessly, or send foes into a magical slumber.</p>
<p>Only pixies can use their dust to its full potential,</p>
<p>but these fey are constantly sought out by mages and</p>
<p>monsters seeking to study or master their power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tiny Tricksters</strong>. While the arrival of visitors piques</p>
<p>their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reveal themselves</p>
<p>at first. They study the visitors from afar to gauge</p>
<p>their temperament or play harmless tricks on them to</p>
<p>measure their reactions. For example, pixies might</p>
<p>tie a dwarf's boots together, create illusions of strange</p>
<p>creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to lead</p>
<p>interlopers astray. If the visitors respond with hostility,</p>
<p>the pixies give them a wide berth. If the visitors are</p>
<p>good natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened</p>
<p>and more friendly. The fey might even emerge and offer</p>
<p>to guide their "guests" along a safe route or invite them</p>
<p>to a tiny yet satisfying feast prepared in their honor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opposed to Violence</strong>. Unlike their fey cousins, the</p>
<p>sprites, pixies abhor weapons and would sooner flee</p>
<p>than get into a physical altercation with any enemy.</p></div>",

<p>becoming even more murderous in the face of death.</p>
<p>Quaggoth Origins. Quaggoths were never an</p>
<p>enlightened species, but they were not a lways the brutal</p>
<p>Underdark denizens they are today. In a distant age,</p>
<p>quaggoth tribes dwelled upon the surface as nocturnal</p>
<p>arboreal hunters, possessing their own language and</p>
<p>culture . When elves appeared in the mortal realm, they</p>
<p>clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to</p>
<p>near extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the Underdark</p>
<p>did the quaggoths survive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As they passed the ages deep beneath the world</strong>, the</p>
<p>quaggoths' fur lost its color and their vision adapted to</p>
<p>the darkness, even as the constant danger and weird</p>
<p>magic of their new realm transformed them. Turning</p>
<p>increasingly brutal and savage, they ate whatever food</p>
<p>they could find-and when they could not find it, they</p>
<p>preyed on each other. As cannibalism became part of</p>
<p>their culture, their past was abandoned.</p>

<p>quaggoths and surface elves makes them easy converts</p>
<p>to the dark elf cause. In recent years, the drow have</p>
<p>taken an interest in breeding quaggoths, encouraging</p>
<p>their ferocity while strengthening their obedience.</p>
<p>Wealthy drow houses have legions of quaggoths at</p>
<p>their command. Even worse, the drow cultivate the</p>
<p>quaggoths' hatred of the elves by leading them on</p>
<p>surface raids against known elven enclaves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thonots</strong>. Some quaggoths absorb psionic energy that</p>
<p>suffuses certain parts of the Underdark. When a tribe</p>
<p>discovers that one of its own has inherited such powers,</p>
<p>they press it into the role of tribal shaman, or thonot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A thonot</strong> keep a tribe's lore and ensures its superiority</p>
<p>against enemies. A thonot that fails the tribe is slain and</p>
<p>devoured in a cannibalistic ritual, in the hope that its</p>
<p>power passes to another more worthy quaggoth.</p>
<p>Poison Immunity. Generations of hunting venomous</p>
<p>subterranean creatures and perpetual exposure to the</p>
<p>molds and fungi that grow in the depths have forced</p>
<p>quaggoths to adapt immunities to poisons of all kinds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VARIANT: QUAGGOTH THONOT</strong></p>
<p>A quaggoth thonot is a normal quaggoth with a challenge</p>
<p>rating of 3 (700 XP) and the following additional trait.</p>
<p>Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The quaggoth's innate</p>
<p>spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 11 ). The</p>
<p>quaggoth can innately cast the following spells, requiring</p>
<p>no components:</p>
<p><strong>At will</strong>: feather fall, mage hand (the hand is invisible)</p>
<p><strong>1 day each</strong>: cure wounds, enlargejreduce, heat metal, mirror image.</p></div>",

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1 ,800 XP)</p>
<p><strong>Regeneration</strong>. The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start</p>
<p>of its turn. If the revenant takes fire or radiant damage, this</p>
<p>trait doesn't function at the start of the revenant's next turn.</p>
<p>The revenant's body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with</p>
<p>0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</p>
<p><strong>Rejuvenation</strong>. When the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul</p>
<p>lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and animates another</p>
<p>corpse on the same plane of existence and regains all its hit</p>
<p>points. While the soul is bodiless, a wish spell can be used to</p>
<p>force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return.</p>
<p><strong>Turn Immunity</strong>. The revenant is immune to effects that</p>
<p>turn undead.</p>
<p><strong>Vengeful</strong> <strong>Tracker</strong>. The revenant knows the distance to and</p>
<p>direction of any creature against which it seeks revenge, even</p>
<p>if the creature and the revenant are on different planes of</p>
<p>existence. If the creature being tracked by the revenant dies,</p>
<p>the revenant knows.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The revenant makes two fist attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Fist</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:</p>
<p>11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature</p>
<p>against which the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target</p>
<p>takes an extra 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing</p>
<p>damage, the revenant can grapple the target (escape DC 14)</p>
<p>provided the target is Large or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Vengeful Glare</strong>. The revenant targets one creature it can see</p>
<p>within 30 feet of it and against which it has sworn vengeance.</p>
<p>The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a</p>
<p>failure, the target is paralyzed until the revenant deals damage</p>
<p>to it, or until the end of the revenant's next turn. When the</p>
<p>paralysis ends, the target is frightened of the revenant for 1</p>
<p>minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at</p>
<p>the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see</p>
<p>the revenant, ending the frightened condition on itself on</p>
<p>a success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A revenant forms</strong> from the soul of a mortal who met a</p>
<p>cruel and undeserving fate. It claws its way back into the</p>
<p>world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it.</p>
<p>The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially</p>
<p>resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes,</p>
<p>a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the</p>
<p>presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original</p>
<p>body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the</p>
<p>spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse.</p>
<p>Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel,</p>
<p>its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what</p>
<p>it truly is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hunger for Revenge</strong>. A revenant has only one year to</p>
<p>exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant</p>
<p>fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it</p>
<p>crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its</p>
<p>foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own,</p>
<p>it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Divine]ustice</strong>. No magic can hide a creature pursued</p>
<p>by a revenant, which always knows the direction and</p>
<p>distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In</p>
<p>cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more</p>
<p>than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time,</p>
<p>starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow.</p>
<p>If the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to</p>
<p>seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Undead Nature</strong>. A revenant doesn't require air, food,</p>
<p>drink, or sleep.</p></div>",

<p>in those it gazes upon. Hags and witches often bind</p>
<p>scarecrows with the spirits of demons, but any evil spirit</p>
<p>will do. Although aspects of the spirit's personality</p>
<p>might surface, a scarecrow's spirit doesn't recall the</p>
<p>memories it had as a creature, and its will is focused</p>
<p>solely on serving its creator. If its creator dies, the spirit</p>
<p>inhabiting a scarecrow either continues to follow its</p>
<p>last commands, seeks revenge for its creator's death, or</p>
<p>destroys itself.</p>

<p><strong>A humanoid host</strong> can carry only one slaad egg to term at a</p>
<p>time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity,</p>
<p>gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period</p>
<p>before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is</p>
<p>halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks,</p>
<p>and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through</p>

<p><strong>Chameleon</strong> <strong>Carapace</strong>. The thri-kreen can change the color of</p>
<p>its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings.</p>
<p>As a result, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks</p>
<p>made to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Leap</strong>. The thri-kreen's long jump is up to 30 feet and</p>
<p>its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The thri-kreen makes two attacks: one with its</p>
<p>bite and one with its claws.</p>
<p><strong>Bite</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.</p>
<p>Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed</p>
<p>on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1</p>
<p>minute. lfthe saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also</p>
<p>paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The poisoned target can</p>
<p>repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect</p>
<p>on itself on a success.</p>
<p><strong>Claws</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thri-kreen wander</strong> the deserts and savannas of the</p>
<p>world, avoiding all other races.</p>
<p>Thri-Kreen Communication. Thri-kreen employ</p>
<p>a language without words. To show emotion and</p>
<p>reaction, a thri-kreen clacks its mandibles and waves its</p>
<p>antennae, giving other thri-kreen a sense of what it is</p>
<p>thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this manner</p>
<p>of communication difficult to interpret and impossible</p>
<p>to duplicate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When forced to interact</strong> with creatures of other</p>
<p>intelligent species, thri-kreen employ alternative</p>
<p>methods of communication, such as drawing pictures in</p>
<p>sand or making pictures out of twigs or blades of grass.</p>
<p>Limited Emotions. Thri-kreen experience the full</p>
<p>range of emotions but aren't as prone to emotional</p>
<p>outbursts as humans. Thri-kreen with psionic</p>
<p>ability often demonstrate a wider range of emotions,</p>
<p>particularly if they live near or interact with humans or</p>
<p>other highly emotional creatures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Isolationists and Wanderers</strong>. Thri-kreen consider</p>
<p>all other living creatures as potential nourishment, and</p>
<p>they love the taste of elf flesh in particular. If a creature</p>
<p>might be useful for something other than food, the thri-</p>
<p>kreen aren't likely to attack it on sight. Thri-kreen kill to</p>
<p>survive, never for sport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sleepless</strong>. Thri-kreen don't require sleep and can rest</p>
<p>while remaining alert and performing light tasks. Their</p>
<p>inability to sleep is thought to be the reason why thri-</p>
<p>kreen have such short lifespans, the average thri-kreen</p>
<p>life expectancy being only thirty years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VARIANT: THRI-KREEN WEAPONS AND PSIONICS</strong></p>
<p>Some thri-kreen employ special martial weapons. A gythka is</p>
<p>a two-handed polearm with a blade at each end. A chatkcha</p>
<p>is a flat, triangular wedge with three serrated blades (a light</p>
<p>thrown weapon).</p>
<p><strong>A thri-kreen armed</strong> with a gythka and chatkchas gains the</p>
<p>following action options:</p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The thri-kreen makes two gythka attacks or</p>
<p>two chatkcha attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Gythka</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one</p>
<p>target. Hit: 5 (1 d8 + 1) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong>Chatkcha</strong>. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120</p>
<p>ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.</p>
<p>A few thri-kreen manifest psionic abilities, using their powers</p>
<p>to aid the hunt and communicate more easily with outsiders.</p>
<p><strong>A psionic thri-kreen</strong> has telepathy out to a range of 60 feet</p>
<p>and gains the following additional trait:</p>
<p><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong> (Psionics). The thri-kreen's innate</p>
<p>spellcasting ability is Wisdom. The thri-kreen can innately</p>
<p>cast the following spells, requiring no components:</p>

<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The troglodyte makes three attacks: one with its</p>
<p>bite and two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong>Bite</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.</p>
<p>Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The savage, degenerate troglodytes</strong> squat in the shallow</p>
<p>depths of the Underdark in a constant state of war</p>
<p>against their neighbors and one another. They mark</p>
<p>the borders of their territories with cracked bones and</p>
<p>skulls, or with pictographs painted in blood or dung.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps the most loathsome of all humanoids</strong>,</p>
<p>troglodytes eat anything they can stomach. They dwell</p>
<p>in filth. The walls of their cavern homes are smeared</p>
<p>with grime, oily secretions, and the debris of their</p>
<p>foul feasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Simpleminded Brutes</strong>. Troglodytes have a simple,</p>
<p>communal culture devoted almost entirely to procuring</p>
<p>food. Too simple to plan more than a few days into the</p>
<p>future, troglodytes rely on constant raids and hunting</p>
<p>to survive. They take sadistic pleasure in hunting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>intelligent creatures weaker</strong> than themselves and show</p>
<p>no mercy toward those they capture and drag qack to</p>
<p>their lairs to be devoured. The largest and toughest</p>
<p>troglodytes lead the hunt and become the leaders of</p>
<p>their tribes. However, if a leader shows any weakness or</p>
<p>hesitation, other troglodytes attack and eat it in a frenzy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Troglodytes make little and build less</strong>, scavenging</p>
<p>their possessions from their prey. They understand</p>
<p>the value of metal weapons and armor, and fight</p>
<p>among one another for the right to have such items. A</p>
<p>troglodyte tribe might be torn apart by battles over a</p>
<p>single longsword.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Devotees of Laogzed</strong>. Some troglodytes venerate</p>
<p>Laogzed, a demonic, monstrously fat toad-lizard that</p>
<p>slumbers in the Abyss. Laogzed offers the troglodytes</p>
<p>nothing in return except aspiration, for it is the dream of</p>
<p>his troglodyte worshipers to become as fat, well-fed, and</p>
<p>wearily content as he seems to be.</p></div>",

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1 ,800 XP)</p>
<p><strong>Confusing Gaze</strong>. When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet</p>
<p>of the umber hulk and is able to see the umber hulk's eyes, the</p>
<p>umber hulk can magically force it to make a DC 15 Charisma</p>
<p>saving throw, unless the umber hulk is incapacitated.</p>
<p>On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions</p>
<p>until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine</p>
<p>what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action but uses all</p>
<p>its movement to move in a random direction. On a '1 or 8, the</p>
<p>creature makes one melee attack against a random creature, or</p>
<p>it does nothing if no creature is within reach.</p>
<p><strong>Unless surprised</strong>, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the</p>
<p>saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it</p>
<p>can't see the umber hulk until the start of its next turn, when it</p>
<p>can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the umber hulk</p>
<p>in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p>
<p><strong>Tunneler</strong>. The umber hulk can burrow through solid rock at</p>
<p>half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5 foot-wide, 8-foot-high</p>
<p>tunnel in its wake.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The umber hulk makes three attacks: two with its</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An abominable horror from deep</strong> beneath the earth, an</p>
<p>umber hulk burrows into cave complexes, dungeons, or</p>
<p>Underdark settlements in search of food. Those lucky</p>
<p>enough to survive an umber hulk attack often remember</p>
<p>precious little of the incident, thanks to the umber hulk's</p>
<p>mind-scrambling gaze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Devious Delvers</strong>. Umber hulks can burrow through</p>
<p>solid rock, forming new tunnels in their wake. The</p>
<p>steel-ha rd chitin of its body can withstand the cave-ins,</p>
<p>tunnel collapses, and rock falls that commonly follow it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Burrowing into</strong> the wall of a cavern or passageway,</p>
<p>an umber hulk lies in wait for creatures to pass by</p>
<p>on the other side, its hair-like feelers sensing any</p>
<p>movement a round it. When it explodes out in a shower</p>
<p>of earth and rock, its unsuspecting quarry turns to face</p>
<p>the oncoming threat-and is entranced by the umber</p>
<p>hulk's bewildering eyes, forced to stand helpless as its</p>
<p>mandibles snap shut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mind Scrambler</strong>. Many survivors of an umber hulk</p>
<p>encounter recollect little about the attack, because the</p>
<p>monster's confusing gaze scrambles their memory of</p>
<p>the event. Those who have fought and killed umber</p>
<p>hulks recognize the signs. For other denizens of</p>
<p>the Underdark, grisly tales of vanished explorers</p>
<p>and wanton destruction speak of an unknown</p>

<p><strong>Umber hulks</strong> take on supernatural status</p>
<p>in these harrowing stories, many of which</p>

<p><strong>A neutral good water weird</strong> tries to frighten away</p>

<p><strong>Arcanaloths are sly, jackal-headed beings</strong> with</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of its chosen form</strong>, an arcanaloth appears</p>
<p>well groomed, clothing itself in fine robes. Highly</p>
<p>intelligent spellcasters who hunger for knowledge and</p>

<p>and maintain the contracts, records, and accounts</p>
<p>of their kind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arcanaloths speak and write all languages</strong>, making</p>

<p>properly paid can broker treaties or alliances with</p>
<p>subtlety and finesse, just as an arcana loth who changes</p>
<p>sides can easily turn the best-laid peace talks into all-out</p>
<p>war. What the fiend demands in exchange for its time</p>
